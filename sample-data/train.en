"The potential productivity gains should be considerable.
Today, QuarkXPress® 8 has tighter integration with Photoshop® and Illustrator® than ever before, and through standards like HTML and CSS, QuarkXPress users can publish across media both independently and alongside Adobe® Creative Suite® applications like Adobe Flash® (SWF) and Adobe Dreamweaver®.
Here, you’ll find out how Creative Suite users can get the best possible interaction with QuarkXPress.
You’ll be surprised how easy Quark has made it to unlock the full potential of all your design software.
QuarkXPress 8 is considered by many to have the best integration with Photoshop’s PSD file format of any layout tool available today.
In this section we’ll explain when you should use the PSD format for your images and how to get the most out of them.
For example, you may have multiple layers in your PSD with different product shots, which will vary from publication to publication.
If you use PSD, you can switch those layers on or off in QuarkXPress without having to save a separate TIFF for each publication.
Another question that might tip you in favor of PSD is, "Do I need to use a spot color with this image?
" Using spot colors in most image formats is often complicated.
However, because of the way QuarkXPress supports PSD channels, it’s simpler and more flexible.
Bringing the PSD files into QuarkXPress is the same as any other image. Create a Box and then use File > Import... or simply drag and drop the image from your desktop, Finder or an application like Adobe Bridge® with or without creating a box first.
To access the special features of PSD, open the PSD Import palette. (Window > PSD Import) You’ll instantly see thumbnails of the layers along with their names.
For example, you’ve created a layer in Photoshop to give your image an antiqued look, but when you put it in your layout it seems swamped by the surrounding colors. One option might be to reduce the opacity of that layer by clicking on it and entering a new opacity level.
If you want to add an extra ink or plate to your images, you can set up a channel to do that in Photoshop. For example, maybe you intend to varnish part of an image, or you want to use a spot color within your image.
QuarkXPress can re­map any channel right in the PSD Import palette — non­destructively.
So click on the channels divider of the PSD Import Palette; double click on the channel in question, and you can pick any color from your project’s color palette, ensuring consistency.
As powerful as the PSD support of QuarkXPress 8 is, it can’t manipulate certain kinds of layers, such as layer effects [e.g.
If you use one of these layers, the image will import and print just fine, but you won’t get access to the layer controls of the PSD Import palette.
If you need that functionality, you can eliminate those kinds of layers from your PSD by converting the layer effects to stand-alone layers or 'smart objects' [right click on the Layer in the Photoshop layers palette].
QuarkXPress supports text layers, most adjustment layers, and even 3D layers including opacity and blending mode controls.
Illustrator is a great tool for creating logos and vector illustrations.
Traditionally, the route into QuarkXPress has been to export an EPS from Illustrator.
Now, things are made much easier with the arrival of direct Illustrator .ai file import into QuarkXPress 8.
Simply drag and drop or import your Illustrator native file into your layout just as you would any graphics file format.
QuarkXPress has a powerful transparency engine, but it doesn’t support partially transparent objects in PDF or .ai files yet.
So if you are using something like a drop shadow in Illustrator and plan to place that over a non-white background or object, you might see undesirable results.
The good news is that the drop shadow and transparency features of QuarkXPress works on imported Illustrator files, so you can apply a drop shadow or change the opacity of your .ai file right in your layout instead.
QuarkXPress is well equipped for drawing tasks and in our newest release we have standardised many of our graphics tools to work more like Illustrator, Freehand and similar tools.
Watch a video on how to create compelling illustrations in QuarkXPress 8.
Page-layout professionals can create rich Flash projects — without compromising design — using the built–in Flash authoring capabilities included in every edition of QuarkXPress 8.
Working in the same familiar print environment of QuarkXPress 8, you can take existing print jobs to Flash, or create new Flash projects, in minutes — no additional purchase or coding required!

The person in the image has tattoos all around the chest area. I've tried so many times to cover the tattoos and couldn't.
I downloaded a trial of Retoucher to see how it would work. One pass over the area with Retoucher and the tattoos were gone.
I was absolutely shocked at how fast and easy Akvis Retoucher made it. You would never know the young lady in the image has a tattoo.
There’s often too much design around, but never enough good design.
This insight prompted the launching in 1983 of the Design Plus competition by Messe Frankfurt in cooperation with the "Rat für Formgebung" (Design Council) and the Deutschen Industrie- und Handelskammertag / Association of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHK).
The Design Plus award, presented by a distinguished jury in conjunction with the Ambiente international consumer goods trade fair in Frankfurt, stands for product design which is not merely an end in itself but instead very much exemplary and trend-setting.

Barbecue and Mate Tea are Argentinian inventions with a social function.
Many Argentinian families have in their own grill in the backyard of their homes (called parrillas), where they meet on the weekends for a meal together with friends and relatives.
The beef here has different cuts to that of Europe.
The "baby bife" is approximately 1/2kg of steak, which could nourish a whole family.
The "bife de chorizo" is a gigantic rump steak , the "bife de lomo" a filet.
"Asado de tira" is the part of the ribs, the "bife de costilla" is a T-bone Steak, the "matambre" is a very thin cut piece of meat with lots of fat.
Like in Europe , meat is prepared rare, mid rare, done, well done etc.
The sauce which comes with the meat dish is called "chimichurri". However, because of the excellent taste of the meat, it can well be eaten without sauce.
A full plate of mixed grill contains practically all animal innards from various animals.
The Sausage (chorizo) and the black pudding (morcilla) are very popular.
Served with the meats are vegetables (sweet potatoes, pumpkin puree) and mixed salads.
In a restaurant it is of course possible to order other parts of meats.
Depending on the season and region, it is possible to eat in Argentina very good food and meat such as deer, lamb, sheep, goat, fish, and other seafood.
Special delicacies are: king prawns (centolla) from Tierra de Fuego and wild boar (jabalí) or trout in Bariloche.
Special dishes, going back as far as colonial times are: "pastel de choclo" or the "humita".
More typical are chicken "pollo" in its most varied prepartions, "milanesa" (Viennese escalope), "empanadas" (fried pastry shells filled with chopped beef, chicken, maize or cheese and ham) or "choripan" similar to a Hot Dog.
Many Italian restaurants are found here which serve pizza and pasta.
Next to fresh fruit salads and good ice cream, a wide range of desserts are offered.
Two Argentine specialities are the "dulce de leche", milk-caramel marmalade which is also used to as a bread spread and the "alfajores" (small cake-formed biscuits with different fillings).

Note: Context support was added with PHP 5.0.0. For a description of contexts, refer to Stream Functions .
Note: If PHP is not properly recognizing the line endings when reading files either on or created by a Macintosh computer, enabling the auto_detect_line_endings run-time configuration option may help resolve the problem.
// Get a file into an array.
// Another example, let's get a web page into a string. See also file_get_contents().
When using SSL, Microsoft IIS will violate the protocol by closing the connection without sending a close_notify indicator. PHP will report this as "SSL: Fatal Protocol Error" when you reach the end of the data.
To work around this, the value of error_reporting should be lowered to a level that does not include warnings.
PHP 4.3.7 and higher can detect buggy IIS server software when you open the stream using the https:// wrapper and will suppress the warning. When using fsockopen() to create an ssl:// socket, the developer is responsible for detecting and suppressing this warning.

This section holds the most general questions about PHP: what it is and what it does.
Can I run several versions of PHP at the same time?
What are the differences between PHP 3 and PHP 4?
What are the differences between PHP 4 and PHP 5?
I think I found a bug! Who should I tell?
Much of its syntax is borrowed from C, Java and Perl with a couple of unique PHP-specific features thrown in.
The goal of the language is to allow web developers to write dynamically generated pages quickly.
This confuses many people because the first word of the acronym is the acronym.
This type of acronym is called a recursive acronym.
For more information, the curious can visit » Free On-Line Dictionary of Computing or the » Wikipedia entry on recursive acronyms .
PHP/FI 2.0 is an early and no longer supported version of PHP.
PHP 3 is the successor to PHP/FI 2.0 and is a lot nicer.
PHP 5 is the current generation of PHP, which uses the » Zend engine 2 which, among other things, offers many additional OOP features.
Please see the » What's new in PHP 4 overview for a detailed explanation of these features and more.
While PHP 5 was purposely designed to be as compatible as possible with previous versions, there are some significant changes.
For more detailed information, please view the section on Migrating from PHP 4 to PHP 5 and the section on Backwards Incompatible Changes .
You should go to the PHP Bug Database and make sure the bug isn't a known bug.
If you don't see it in the database, use the reporting form to report the bug.
It is important to use the bug database instead of just sending an email to one of the mailing lists because the bug will have a tracking number assigned and it will then be possible for you to go back later and check on the status of the bug.

Note: Note that JPC and JP2 are capable of having components with different bit depths.
In this case, the value for "bits" is the highest bit depth encountered.
Also, JP2 files may contain multiple JPEG 2000 codestreams.
In this case, getimagesize() returns the values for the first codestream it encounters in the root of the file.
Note: The information about icons are retrieved from the icon with the highest bitrate.
It can reference a local file or (configuration permitting) a remote file using one of the supported streams.
This optional parameter allows you to extract some extended information from the image file.
Currently, this will return the different JPG APP markers as an associative array.
Some programs use these APP markers to embed text information in images.
A very common one is to embed » IPTC information in the APP13 marker.
You can use the iptcparse() function to parse the binary APP13 marker into something readable.
Returns an array with 7 elements.
Index 0 and 1 contains respectively the width and the height of the image.
Note: Some formats may contain no image or may contain multiple images.
In these cases, getimagesize() might not be able to properly determine the image size. getimagesize() will return zero for width and height in these cases.
Index 2 is one of the IMAGETYPE_XXX constants indicating the type of the image.
Index 3 is a text string with the correct height="yyy" width="xxx" string that can be used directly in an IMG tag.
channels will be 3 for RGB pictures and 4 for CMYK pictures.
Support for JPC, JP2, JPX, JB2, XBM, and WBMP became available.

For the last few years the European Patent Office (EPO) has, contrary to the letter and spirit of the existing law, granted more than 30000 patents on rules of organisation and calculation claimed in terms of general-purpose computing equipment, called "programs for computers" in the law of 1973 and "computer-implemented inventions" in EPO Newspeak since 2000.
Europe's patent movement is pressing to legitimate this practise by writing a new law.
Although the patent movement has lost major battles in November 2000 and September 2003, Europe's programmers and citizens are still facing considerable risks.
Here you find the basic documentation, starting from the latest news and a short overview.
The patent movement has during several decades won the support of large corporations and governments for its expansionist cause.
Yet FFII, Eurolinux and others have devoted themselves to this work with considerable success.
Still, we continue to have more tasks than free hands.
Here we tell you how you can help us move forward more quickly.
A database of the monopolies on programming problems, which the European Patent Office has granted against the letter and spirit of the existing laws, and about which it is unsufficiently informing the public, delivering only chunks of graphical data hidden behind input masks.
The FFII software patent workgroup is trying to single out the software patents, make them better accessible and show their effects on software development.
During the last few years, the European Patent Office (EPO) has granted several 10000 patents on computer-implemented rules of organisation and calculation, i.e. programs for computers [ as such ].
We are systematically collecting these patents and republishing them in a more accessible form.

It’s the last month of the year… time to look back on this year and time to embrace the new one.
For the Kindo team it was a very exciting one and we are busy working in the arms of the MyHeritage family.
You can read the announcement here (pdf) , or get the complete FAQ here, but I wanted to give you some more background on why Kindo and MyHeritage have teamed up.
The first time we met Gilad, the founder and CEO of Myheritage, was in early 2007 – a few weeks before we released the first public version of Kindo.
Gareth and me were invited to have lunch with him in Soho in central London, and went there with the objective of learning everything we could about the “enemy”.
This proved to be pretty naive, since Gilad is much too nice to be called an “enemy”.
But there we were: A Swede, a South African and an Israeli, all with very different professional background and life stories, talking about the future of families online from very different perspectives.
I didn’t expect this, but we found that we had much in common.
We shared the same ideas and vision for what we wanted to achieve with our businesses, even though our approach was far from similar.
Kindo had set out to build a site that would help you interact with the family that is around you here and now.
We were trying to come up with tools to help you share information and communicate with the people that matter most to you right now.
MyHeritage on the other hand had developed amazing technologies to help you find out everything about your family’s history, and had spent years perfecting these technologies.
Ultimately though, what interested us both was the opportunity to help families discover more about who they are and their past, and use the web to bring them closer together.
As Gareth and I travelled back on the tube, we talked about how nice it would be to be able to offer our own users the same tools as MyHeritage already had.
What really got us excited was their SmartMatching Technology, which matches people in your family tree with 250 Million other names, and suggests who you might be related too.
During this summer, we’ve been thinking long and hard about the future of Kindo, and what the best option would be for taking Kindo to the next level.
The more time we spent with Gilad as well as the rest of the team in Israel (not to mention the very loud rooster that runs around in their campus), the more convinced we all became - we’ll be better off together.
So we join the MyHeritage family because we share the same vision and values (as families should), and because we think that we can build an amazing product together – bringing real benefits to families around the world.
This is what we’re planning to do over the next years.
As you see from the smiles in the picture below, this is a happy day for us here in the Putney Offices.
This years Swedish Genealogy Days the yearly conference of the Swedish Federation of Genealogical Societies was held in the city of Malmö in the province of Skåne in southern Sweden.
Over 100 exibitors crowded in the convention center at Europaporten in Malmö. Everything from genealogical societies, archives to companies offering original sources online.
In the meanwhile, you can still work on your profiles and upload the photos from the weekend’s family reunion.
Update: Now everything is fixed! It was the database acting a bit weird but Stephen has done a great job to fix it.
Everyone hits a brick wall in genealogy, where the birth and death records just aren’t easy to find. In that case, try some different records.
Deeds often contain information on who sold what to whom; who inherited what from whom; or how some land was divided among a family. Historic tax records on land also sometimes have interesting information, such as co-ownership.
Just as the squirrels and different kinds of birds collect nuts and seeds, someone in the Kindo office seems to be doing some really solid forward planning.
Judging from this picture - it’s going to be a looong winter.
As I point out in my book, Genealogy Online 8th Edition , you can do a lot of good research using search engines and Boolean operators (AND, NOT, OR, and parentheses. ) Recently, Yahoo!
Advanced Google still accepts the most popular Boolean terms, and Exalead even supports the NEAR operator, which really helps with common surnames, but Live Search is now the only major search engine with full Boolean support.
For more details on how to do the Boolean Boogie for genealogy, read Genealogy Online 8th Edition .
Most beginners to genealogy are fuzzy about cousinship. For example, while many understand first cousins are people with common grandparents, many folks confuse first cousin once removed and second cousin.
Then, there are families like mine: My mother’s siblings were born from 1911 to 1932. That means her youngest brother “Mike” went to school with the oldest sister’s oldest child, his niece “Karen”.
As it turned out, Uncle “Mike” and niece “Karen” married two people who were siblings, “Michelle” and “Kevin”, making their children both first cousins and first cousins once removed.
Showing degrees of relationship by blood.
“Using DNA is one of the newest and latest tools of tracing your genealogy, and it’s remarkable,” said Wells, who represented Family Tree DNA .”You can see if they migrated, you can find out more about your great-aunt and maybe she acted strangely, but that was because she had a baby die at childbirth … you just never know what secrets the past will reveal,” Wells said.
-First it does not replace paper documentation since it does not name common ancestors, it is more a tool to prove lineage.
Several companies, like Family Tree DNA, can assist you to confirm your family tree or allow you to determine whether two people are related if you give them DNA of someone.
- It’s less reffective for females to use DNA than for males because thanks to Y-DNA, we can determine paternal and maternal lines, whereas for females it is just maternal.
Here are a few suggestions to get you started: Introduction to Genealogy from National Genealogical Society (U.S.) Most genealogists take this course first. It is very American-centric, but the techniques can be applied to any country’s vital statistics.

Lufthansa owes its origins to "Deutsche Luft Hansa Aktiengesellschaft" (renamed "Lufthansa" in 1933), which is formed from a merger between "Deutsche Aero Lloyd" (DAL) and "Junkers Luftverkehr" on January 6.
The new airline inherits its crane logo, designed by "Deutsche Luft-Reederei" in 1919, from DAL, the blue-and-yellow house colours from Junkers.
It commences scheduled flights on April 6 with a fleet of 162 aircraft, of 18 different types.
A flying expedition to China is the event of the year.
Following its acquisition of shares in 1926 in the German-Russian "Dereluft" airline, which was founded in 1921, Lufthansa is influential in the founding of the Spanish Iberia, the Brazilian "Syndicato Condor" and the Chinese "Eurasia" airlines.
Lufthansa opens the first trans-oceanic, scheduled airmail service across the South Atlantic.
Between 1936 and 1938, it also experiments with scheduled air services across the North Atlantic.
After substantial expansion of the route network in 1939including flights to Bangkok and Santiago de Chilewartime air services, except for a few European countries, are suspended.
All flights are discontinued in 1945 and Lufthansa goes into receivership and is finally wound up and struck from the Berlin commercial register in 1965.
The Federal Transport Minister sets up a working committee in 1951 to prepare for the resumption of air traffic in postwar Germany and entrusts the job of implementation to "Büro Bongers", the office headed by Hans M. Bongers, the traffic chief of the old Lufthansa in Cologne. A new company to run air services and named "Aktiengesellschaft für Luftverkehrsbedarf" (Luftag) is founded in Cologne on January 6, 1953.
Lufthansa enters the jet age, initially on long-haul routes, with the arrival in the fleet of the Boeing 707.
The last of the propeller-driven aircraft, a Vickers Viscount, is retired in 1971.
Conversion to jet aircraft continues with the start of flights on medium-haul routes with the Boeing 727 and, on short-haul, with the Boeing 737, the city jet largely fathered by Lufthansa.
The wide-body era begins at Lufthansa with the delivery of its first Boeing 747 jumbo jet in 1970, later to be joined by the McDonnell-Douglas DC10 and the A300, the first of the jets from the newly founded European aircraftmaker.
Lufthansa resumes flights to Berlin 45 years after the end of World War Two following Germany's reunification.
Lufthansa masters its worst-ever economic crisis with a sweeping rehabilitation programme.
The airline, largely owned by the state, is privatised step by step.
Its MRO, cargo and IT businesses are spun off as independent companies.
Lufthansa, Air Canada, SAS, Thai Airways und United Airlines create the "Star Alliance", the world's first multilateral airline grouping, later to be joined by other carriers.
The Lufthansa Aviation Group equips itself for the new millenium, training its focus on innovation and quality.
Placement of orders for 15 Airbus A380 megaliners charts the airline’s path into the future.
Even during times of crisis in the aviation industry, Lufthansa remains on the ascent: With the “Future European Operations“ programme, the airline reorganises its regional markets, while gaining new partner airlines to expand the Star Alliance global route network.
Passengers enjoy greater comfort in a completely revamped Business Class with fast broadband Internet connectivity in the aircraft cabin.

DLNA (Digital Living Network Alliance) is a standard that enables digital devices such as personal computers, digital video recorders, and TVs to be connected on a network and to share data that is on other connected, DLNA-compatible devices.
"Servers" distribute media such as image, music, or video files, and "clients" receive and play the media.
Using a PS3™ system as a client, you can display images, or play music or video files that are stored on a device with DLNA Media Server functionality over a network.
Connect the PS3™ system and DLNA Media Server using a wired or wireless connection.
Set up the DLNA Media Server so that it can be used by the PS3™ system.
The following devices can be used as DLNA Media Servers.
Enable the DLNA Media Server function of the connected device to make its content available for shared access.
The setup method varies depending on the connected device.
For details, refer to the instructions supplied with the device.
A Microsoft® Windows® personal computer can be used as a DLNA Media Server by using Windows Media® Player 11 functions.
From the list of devices under the [Share media] checkbox, select the devices that you want to share data with, and then select [Allow].
Setup for the DLNA Media Server is completed.
Windows Media® Player 11 is not installed by default on a Microsoft® Windows® personal computer.
Download the installer from the Microsoft® Web site to install Windows Media® Player 11.
For details about how to use Windows Media® Player 11, refer to the Windows Media® Player 11 Help feature.

Normally when I set up plugin-level SEO on a WordPress blog, I’ll need 5-8 plugins to provide all the desired SEO functionality. Wouldn’t it be cool if there was one plugin that incorporated all that functionality and more into one easy-to-use suite?
There is finally an official answer to the question of whether or not WordPress themes must “inherit” the GPL license that WordPress itself uses.
Matt asked the Software Freedom Law Center to examine the WordPress source and how themes fit in. The final, official answer to whether themes must be GPL?
The WordPress Plugin Competition is the best moment of the year, plugin wise.
This year’s edition is still running till the end of the month of July and as of writing, there are about 10 plugins (with some really interesting stuff). Still, new plugins are released every day.
Why aren’t these authors joining the competition? Participating in the competition is Instructive: you *will* learn something.
If WordPress were a country, our Bill of Rights would be the GPL because it protects our core freedoms.
We’ve always done our best to keep WordPress.org clean and only promote things that are completely compatible and legal with WordPress’ license.
There have been some questions in the community about whether the GPL applies to themes like we’ve always assumed.
The Official WordPress Commercial Theme Directory is now open. It is linked off the WordPress Extend and is part of the parent theme directory set of links.
It is not as much a directory as it is a listing of sites that offer commercial GPL themes.
If you aren’t already following along, I highly recommend checking out the How To Create A WordPress Theme tutorial series by Ian Stewart (ThemeShaper.com).
This 12-part series (8 complete at the time of this writing) aims to take you from nothing to a fully functional, semantically rich, flexible WordPress theme in digestible chunks.
Along the way, Ian describes the changes being made, and why you are making them.
A critical vulnerability has been discovered in the WordPress Plugin Related Sites plugin.
An exploit is available in the wild and available on Milw0rm, making this attack easier to exploit.
Although, the vulnerability says that version 2.1 is vulnerable.
You should assume previous versions are vulnerable as well.
DM Albums™ is an inline photo album/gallery plugin that displays high quality images and thumbnails perfectly sized to your blog. Two vulnerabilities have been made public: 1.
WP Roadmap aims to create a detailed view of how WordPress works, by organizing the list of calls by the order in which they are executed The code currently tracks actions, filters, includes, and requires.
WP Roadmap can track the order of these calls from different page views and different versions of WordPress.
WordPress Configuration Tricks : If you have ever installed WordPress and wanted to know what else you could do with your wp-config.php file, this is the blog post to read.
As Ozh points out in the comments, a couple of tricks were left out but nothing that could not be remedied with a simple Google search (e.g.
WP_HTTP) as long as you know what you are looking for.
Tips from that page that got me thinking (things that make you go hmmmmm?
Beta 2 is here. Get it while it’s…still not quite out of Beta…or something.
Dev4Press has done some interesting work on benchmarking various aspects of WordPress and then testing out some popular questions on page loads etc.
The methodologies are well documented and the benchmarking setup is standardized.
They are testing three version of WordPress including 2.6.5, 2.7.1 and 2.8 (I wish they would have waited for 2.8.1 to be released).
Are you one of those worried about the progress of your WordPress blog? Do you wanna know how your visitors found you and how they interact with your site?
Well, it requires you to drill down the site analytics to get to the bottom.
Google Analytics is a trusted third party service that provides an accurate view and detailed analysis of performance statistics of your website without asking for your own resource. It may sound strange that some other website is tracking your performance without you having to provide anything.
What do you mean by a virtual world? A place where you can come and work and chat and play and leave.

Live Streaming video from WordCamp Dallas thanks to Cali Lewis of GeekBrief.tv. Thanks to WPTavern for the link.
I was at WordCamp Dallas last year but could not make it to this one. I am jealous!
WordCamp Dallas 2009 is going on this weekend in the DFW area, and The WordPress Podcast is happy to be one the sponsors.

2.8.1 Beta 2 is ready for testing. Download it, check out the changes since beta 1, and review all tickets fixed in 2.8.1.
We especially suggest, recommend, and beg that plugin developers test their plugins against beta 2 and let us know of any issues.
One of the sites I’m running is a long established community website with zillions of posts and bazillions of comments.
The whole stuff is powered by a home made CMS written in Perl, something I did nearly 10 years ago and that is totally outdated today.
It's not uncommon that a blog runs by different authors, so it may be useful if you can have a quick look at the drafts of all authors.
In our joint blog WP Engineer we created a feed, which keeps us up to date if a new draft of all authors were created. The work of every author is different and the dashboard is the center of information.
Therefore we have decided to supplement a widget in the Dashboard, which shows the last five drafts of all authors. I enhanced the existing Plugin Draft Feed.
So, if I didn’t forget to upload a zip archive or to press a “Commit” button, it should be all here for you: the GPL’d URL shortener I wrote about earlier that Lester Chan and I have been using for a while now.
Our URL shortener service is called YOURLS, as in Your Own URL Shortener. It’s all GPL, free, do-what-you-want-with-it.

This is definitely great news since this milestone was reached in 12 days, have you upgraded to WordPress 2.8 yet? Thanks @photomatt via twitter.
By the time you’re reading this, it is quite possible that the BuddyPress revolution will have happened, but if you’re reading this soon after this was posted, I can safely say that the BuddyPress revolution hasn’t happened yet. It’s under way, but is hasn’t happened.
One week after AC/DC’s Black Ice Tour in Paris, I’ve had yet another musical rendez-vous: Hellfest Open Air 2009 (momentarily closed as of writing), a music festival held about 30 kms from where I currently live.

Since so many people are having simple problems with their WordPress 2.8 installations, the WordPress community is working tirelessly to get a point-one update out as soon as possible, and the first step on that road is to test a beta of the release.
WordPress 2.8.1 Beta 1 has been released, and they need people to test it out and see if it fixes the problems, so if you are having issues with WordPress 2.8, try the beta, and see if that resolves it.
Some plugins are causing grief for those upgrading to 2.8. HyperDB needs to be updated to the latest version, otherwise tags won’t save.
Plugins that load old versions of jQuery for all admin pages will break all kinds of stuff. Plugins should use the version of jQuery that ships with WP.

Lottery remains for centuries one of the most common forms of gambling endorsed by governments worldwide.
The very first signs of this popular trend take us way back to the Han Dynasty in the Far East where a Lottery was used to aid in the finance of major governmental projects, targeted mainly to glorify the government and its people.
The game of Lottery is very strongly printed in today�s culture and even celebrated with splendor as we approach the holiday season.
The biggest celebration by far takes us to our neighboring Spain, where locals participate and enjoy Spain�s national Christmas lottery game known as �El Gordo� (The Fat One), since 1812.
As well as being one of the oldest lotteries around, the total prize pool in recent years, have surpassed the 2 billion Euro mark, making it also the biggest lottery worldwide!!
With prizes being so high, more than 100 new millionaires are produced every Christmas.
��El Gordo� works differently to most lottery games played, as countless people can share one single ticket.
A whole lottery ticket (�billete�) costs a few thousand Euros but these tickets are split to smaller sections, each costing around 20 Euros.
This means that many, even strangers, may share a whole ticket.
The idea is quite befitting especially now, in holiday season where many people in one community share a grand prize worth millions.
Such an event can even affect the local economy.
The El Gordo takes place every 22nd of December and again on the 5th of January.
The whole drawing process takes at least three hours to complete, with the entire community tuned to the radio in suspense.
Participation is also available through the internet, so now you don�t necessarily have to be in Spain in order to enter this grand lottery event.

The Lord warns Nephi to depart into the wilderness.
His journeyings in the wilderness, and so forth.
Lehi prophesies of a land of liberty—His seed shall be scattered and smitten if they reject the Holy One of Israel—He exhorts his sons to put on the armor of righteousness.
1 And now it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had made an end of teaching my brethren, our a father , Lehi, also spake many things unto them, and rehearsed unto them, how great things the Lord had done for them in bringing them out of the land of Jerusalem.
2 And he spake unto them concerning their a rebellions upon the waters, and the mercies of God in sparing their lives, that they were not swallowed up in the sea.
3 And he also spake unto them concerning the land of promise, which they had obtained—how a merciful the Lord had been in b warning us that we should flee out of the land of Jerusalem.
4 For, behold, said he, I have a seen a b vision , in which I know that c Jerusalem is d destroyed ; and had we remained in Jerusalem we should also have e perished .
5 But, said he, notwithstanding our afflictions, we have obtained a a land of promise, a land which is b choice above all other lands; a land which the Lord God hath c covenanted with me should be a land for the inheritance of my seed.
Yea, the Lord hath d covenanted this land unto me, and to my children forever, and also all those who should be e led out of other countries by the hand of the Lord.
6 Wherefore, I, Lehi, prophesy according to the workings of the Spirit which is in me, that there shall a none come into this land save they shall be brought by the hand of the Lord.
7 Wherefore, this a land is consecrated unto him whom he shall bring.
And if it so be that they shall serve him according to the commandments which he hath given, it shall be a land of b liberty unto them; wherefore, they shall never be brought down into captivity; if so, it shall be because of iniquity; for if iniquity shall abound c cursed shall be the land for their sakes, but unto the righteous it shall be blessed forever.
8 And behold, it is wisdom that this land should be a kept as yet from the knowledge of other b nations ; for behold, many nations would overrun the land, that there would be no place for an inheritance.
9 Wherefore, I, Lehi, have obtained a a promise , that b inasmuch as those whom the Lord God shall bring out of the land of Jerusalem shall keep his commandments, they shall c prosper upon the face of this land; and they shall be kept from all other nations, that they may possess this land unto themselves.
And if it so be that they shall d keep his commandments they shall be blessed upon the face of this land, and there shall be none to molest them, nor to take away the land of their e inheritance ; and they shall dwell safely forever.
10 But behold, when the time cometh that they shall dwindle in a unbelief , after they have received so great blessings from the hand of the Lord—having a knowledge of the creation of the earth, and all men, knowing the great and marvelous works of the Lord from the creation of the world; having power given them to do all things by faith; having all the commandments from the beginning, and having been brought by his infinite goodness into this precious land of promise—behold, I say, if the day shall come that they will reject the Holy One of Israel, the true b Messiah , their Redeemer and their God, behold, the judgments of him that is c just shall rest upon them.
11 Yea, he will bring a other nations unto them, and he will give unto them power, and he will take away from them the lands of their possessions, and he will cause them to be b scattered and smitten.
12 Yea, as one generation passeth to another there shall be a bloodsheds , and great visitations among them; wherefore, my sons, I would that ye would remember; yea, I would that ye would hearken unto my words.
13 O that ye would awake; awake from a deep a sleep , yea, even from the sleep of b hell , and shake off the awful c chains by which ye are bound, which are the chains which bind the children of men, that they are carried away captive down to the eternal d gulf of misery and woe.
and arise from the dust, and hear the words of a trembling a parent , whose limbs ye must soon lay down in the cold and silent b grave , from whence no traveler can c return ; a few more d days and I go the e way of all the earth.
15 But behold, the Lord hath a redeemed my soul from hell; I have beheld his b glory , and I am encircled about eternally in the c arms of his d love .
16 And I desire that ye should remember to observe the a statutes and the judgments of the Lord; behold, this hath been the anxiety of my soul from the beginning.
18 Or, that a a cursing should come upon you for the space of b many generations; and ye are visited by sword, and by famine, and are hated, and are led according to the will and captivity of the c devil .
19 O my sons, that these things might not come upon you, but that ye might be a choice and a a favored people of the Lord.
But behold, his will be done; for his b ways are righteousness forever.
20 And he hath said that: a Inasmuch as ye shall keep my b commandments ye shall c prosper in the land; but inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from my presence.
22 That ye may not be a cursed with a sore cursing; and also, that ye may not incur the displeasure of a b just God upon you, unto the destruction, yea, the eternal destruction of both soul and body.
23 Awake, my sons; put on the armor of a righteousness .
Shake off the b chains with which ye are bound, and come forth out of obscurity, and arise from the dust.
24 Rebel no more against your brother, whose views have been a glorious , and who hath kept the commandments from the time that we left Jerusalem; and who hath been an instrument in the hands of God, in bringing us forth into the land of promise; for were it not for him, we must have perished with b hunger in the wilderness; nevertheless, ye sought to c take away his life; yea, and he hath suffered much sorrow because of you.
25 And I exceedingly fear and tremble because of you, lest he shall suffer again; for behold, ye have a accused him that he sought power and b authority over you; but I know that he hath not sought for power nor authority over you, but he hath sought the glory of God, and your own eternal welfare.
26 And ye have murmured because he hath been plain unto you.
Ye say that he hath used a sharpness ; ye say that he hath been angry with you; but behold, his b sharpness was the sharpness of the power of the word of God, which was in him; and that which ye call anger was the truth, according to that which is in God, which he could not restrain, manifesting boldly concerning your iniquities.
27 And it must needs be that the a power of God must be with him, even unto his commanding you that ye must obey.
But behold, it was not he, but it was the b Spirit of the Lord which was in him, which c opened his mouth to utterance that he could not shut it.
28 And now my son, Laman, and also Lemuel and Sam, and also my sons who are the sons of Ishmael, behold, if ye will hearken unto the voice of Nephi ye shall not perish.
And if ye will hearken unto him I leave unto you a a blessing , yea, even my first blessing.
29 But if ye will not hearken unto him I take away my a first blessing, yea, even my blessing, and it shall rest upon him.
30 And now, Zoram, I speak unto you: Behold, thou art the a servant of Laban; nevertheless, thou hast been brought out of the land of Jerusalem, and I know that thou art a true b friend unto my son, Nephi, forever.
31 Wherefore, because thou hast been faithful thy seed shall be blessed a with his seed, that they dwell in prosperity long upon the face of this land; and nothing, save it shall be iniquity among them, shall harm or disturb their prosperity upon the face of this land forever.
32 Wherefore, if ye shall keep the commandments of the Lord, the Lord hath consecrated this land for the security of thy seed with the seed of my son.
Redemption cometh through the Holy Messiah—Freedom of choice (agency) is essential to existence and progression—Adam fell that men might be—Men are free to choose liberty and eternal life.
1 And now, Jacob, I speak unto you: Thou art my a first -born in the days of my tribulation in the wilderness.
And behold, in thy childhood thou hast suffered afflictions and much sorrow, because of the rudeness of thy brethren.
2 Nevertheless, Jacob, my first-born in the wilderness, thou knowest the greatness of God; and he shall consecrate thine a afflictions for thy gain.
3 Wherefore, thy soul shall be blessed, and thou shalt dwell safely with thy brother, Nephi; and thy days shall be a spent in the service of thy God.
Wherefore, I know that thou art redeemed, because of the righteousness of thy Redeemer; for thou hast b beheld that in the c fulness of time he cometh to bring salvation unto men.
4 And thou hast a beheld in thy youth his glory; wherefore, thou art blessed even as they unto whom he shall minister in the flesh; for the Spirit is the same, yesterday, today, and forever.
And the way is prepared from the fall of man, and b salvation is c free .
5 And men are instructed sufficiently that they a know good from evil.
And the b law is given unto men.
And by the law no flesh is c justified ; or, by the law men are d cut off.
Yea, by the temporal law they were cut off; and also, by the spiritual law they perish from that which is good, and become miserable forever.
6 Wherefore, a redemption cometh in and through the b Holy c Messiah ; for he is full of d grace and truth.
7 Behold, he offereth himself a a sacrifice for sin, to answer the ends of the law, unto all those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit; and unto b none else can the c ends of the law be answered.
8 Wherefore, how great the importance to make these things known unto the inhabitants of the earth, that they may know that there is no flesh that can dwell in the presence of God, a save it be through the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah, who b layeth down his life according to the flesh, and taketh it again by the power of the Spirit, that he may bring to pass the c resurrection of the dead, being the first that should rise.
9 Wherefore, he is the firstfruits unto God, inasmuch as he shall make a intercession for all the children of men; and they that believe in him shall be saved.
10 And because of the intercession for a all , all men come unto God; wherefore, they stand in the presence of him, to be b judged of him according to the truth and c holiness which is in him.
11 For it must needs be, that there is an a opposition in all things.
If not so, my first-born in the wilderness, righteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery, neither good nor bad.
Wherefore, all things must needs be a compound in one; wherefore, if it should be one body it must needs remain as dead, having no life neither death, nor corruption nor incorruption, happiness nor misery, neither sense nor insensibility.
12 Wherefore, it must needs have been created for a thing of naught; wherefore there would have been no a purpose in the end of its creation.
Wherefore, this thing must needs destroy the wisdom of God and his eternal purposes, and also the power, and the mercy, and the b justice of God.
13 And if ye shall say there is a no law, ye shall also say there is no sin.
If ye shall say there is no sin, ye shall also say there is no righteousness.
And if there be no righteousness there be no happiness.
And if there be no righteousness nor happiness there be no punishment nor misery.
And if these things are not b there is no God.
And if there is no God we are not, neither the earth; for there could have been no creation of things, neither to act nor to be acted upon; wherefore, all things must have vanished away.
14 And now, my sons, I speak unto you these things for your profit and a learning ; for there is a God, and he hath b created all things, both the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are, both things to act and things to be c acted upon.
15 And to bring about his eternal a purposes in the end of man, after he had b created our first parents, and the beasts of the field and the c fowls of the air, and in fine, all things which are created, it must needs be that there was an opposition; even the d forbidden e fruit in f opposition to the g tree of life; the one being sweet and the other bitter.
16 Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should a act for himself.
Wherefore, man could not b act for himself save it should be that he was c enticed by the one or the other.
17 And I, Lehi, according to the things which I have read, must needs suppose that an a angel of God, according to that which is written, had b fallen from heaven; wherefore, he became a c devil , having sought that which was evil before God.
18 And because he had fallen from heaven, and had become miserable forever, he a sought also the misery of all mankind.
Wherefore, he said unto Eve, yea, even that old serpent, who is the devil, who is the father of all b lies , wherefore he said: Partake of the forbidden fruit, and ye shall not die, but ye shall be as God, c knowing good and evil.
19 And after Adam and Eve had a partaken of the forbidden fruit they were driven out of the garden of b Eden , to till the earth.
20 And they have brought forth children; yea, even the a family of all the earth.
21 And the days of the children of a men were prolonged, according to the b will of God, that they might c repent while in the flesh; wherefore, their state became a state of d probation , and their time was lengthened, according to the commandments which the Lord God gave unto the children of men.
For he gave commandment that all men must repent; for he showed unto all men that they were e lost , because of the transgression of their parents.
22 And now, behold, if Adam had not transgressed he would not have fallen, but he would have remained in the garden of Eden.
And all things which were created must have remained in the same state in which they were after they were created; and they must have remained forever, and had no end.
23 And they would have had no a children ; wherefore they would have remained in a state of innocence, having no b joy , for they knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no c sin .
24 But behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of him who a knoweth all things.
25 a Adam b fell that men might be; and men c are , that they might have d joy .
26 And the a Messiah cometh in the fulness of time, that he may b redeem the children of men from the fall.
And because that they are c redeemed from the fall they have become d free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon, save it be by the punishment of the e law at the great and last day, according to the commandments which God hath given.
27 Wherefore, men are a free according to the b flesh ; and c all things are d given them which are expedient unto man.
And they are free to e choose f liberty and eternal g life , through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be h miserable like unto himself.
29 And not choose eternal death, according to the will of the flesh and the a evil which is therein, which giveth the spirit of the devil power to b captivate , to bring you down to c hell , that he may reign over you in his own kingdom.
30 I have spoken these few words unto you all, my sons, in the last days of my probation; and I have chosen the good part, according to the words of the prophet.
And I have none other object save it be the everlasting a welfare of your souls.
The Gods finish their planning of the creation of all things—They bring to pass the creation according to their plans—Adam names every living creature.
1 And thus we will finish the heavens and the earth, and all the a hosts of them.
2 And the Gods said among themselves: On the seventh time we will end our work, which we have counseled; and we will a rest on the b seventh time from all our work which we have counseled.
3 And the Gods concluded upon the seventh time, because that on the seventh time they would a rest from all their b works which they (the Gods) counseled among themselves to form; and c sanctified it.
And thus were their decisions at the time that they counseled among themselves to form the heavens and the earth.
5 According to all that which they had said concerning every plant of the field before it was in the a earth , and every herb of the field before it grew; for the Gods had not caused it to rain upon the earth when they counseled to do them, and had not formed a man to till the ground.
6 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
7 And the a Gods formed man from the b dust of the ground, and took his c spirit (that is, the man’s spirit), and put it into him; and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living d soul .
8 And the Gods planted a garden, eastward in a Eden , and there they put the man, whose spirit they had put into the body which they had formed.
9 And out of the ground made the Gods to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food; the a tree of life, also, in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
10 There was a river running out of Eden, to water the garden, and from thence it was parted and became into four heads.
11 And the Gods took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden, to dress it and to keep it.
13 But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the time that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die.
Now I, Abraham, saw that it was after the Lord’s a time , which was after the time of b Kolob ; for as yet the Gods had not appointed unto Adam his reckoning.
14 And the Gods said: Let us make an help meet for the man, for it is not good that the man should be alone, therefore we will form an help meet for him.
16 And of the rib which the Gods had taken from man, formed they a a woman , and brought her unto the man.
18 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall a cleave unto his wife, and they shall be b one flesh.
19 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not a ashamed .
20 And out of the ground the Gods formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air, and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them; and whatsoever a Adam called every living creature, that should be the name thereof.
21 And Adam gave a names to all b cattle , to the fowl of the air, to every beast of the field; and for Adam, there was found an c help meet for him.
Men are called as high priests because of their exceeding faith and good works—They are to teach the commandments—Through righteousness they are sanctified and enter into the rest of the Lord—Melchizedek was one of these—Angels are declaring glad tidings throughout the land—They will reveal the actual coming of Christ.
1 And again, my brethren, I would cite your minds forward to the time when the Lord God gave these commandments unto his children; and I would that ye should remember that the Lord God a ordained priests, after his holy order, which was after the order of his Son, to teach these things unto the people.
2 And those priests were ordained after the a order of his Son, in a b manner that thereby the people might know in what manner to look forward to his Son for redemption.
3 And this is the manner after which they were ordained—being a called and b prepared from the c foundation of the world according to the d foreknowledge of God, on account of their exceeding faith and good works; in the first place being left to e choose good or evil; therefore they having chosen good, and exercising exceedingly great f faith , are g called with a holy calling, yea, with that holy calling which was prepared with, and according to, a preparatory redemption for such.
4 And thus they have been a called to this holy calling on account of their faith, while others would reject the Spirit of God on account of the hardness of their hearts and b blindness of their minds, while, if it had not been for this they might have had as great c privilege as their brethren.
9 Thus they become a high priests forever, after the order of the Son, the Only Begotten of the Father, who is without beginning of days or end of years, who is full of b grace , equity, and truth.
11 Therefore they were called after this holy order, and were a sanctified , and their b garments were washed white through the blood of the Lamb.
12 Now they, after being a sanctified by the b Holy Ghost, having their garments made white, being c pure and spotless before God, could not look upon d sin save it were with e abhorrence ; and there were many, exceedingly great many, who were made pure and entered into the rest of the Lord their God.
13 And now, my brethren, I would that ye should humble yourselves before God, and bring forth a fruit meet for repentance, that ye may also enter into that rest.
14 Yea, humble yourselves even as the people in the days of a Melchizedek , who was also a high priest after this same order which I have spoken, who also took upon him the high priesthood forever.
15 And it was this same Melchizedek to whom Abraham paid a tithes ; yea, even our father Abraham paid tithes of one-tenth part of all he possessed.
16 Now these a ordinances were given after this b manner , that thereby the people might look forward on the Son of God, it being a c type of his order, or it being his order, and this that they might look forward to him for a remission of their sins, that they might enter into the rest of the Lord.
18 But Melchizedek having exercised mighty faith, and received the office of the high priesthood according to the a holy order of God, did preach repentance unto his people.
And behold, they did repent; and Melchizedek did establish peace in the land in his days; therefore he was called the prince of peace, for he was the king of Salem; and he did reign under his father.
19 Now, there were a many before him, and also there were many afterwards, but b none were greater; therefore, of him they have more particularly made mention.
20 Now I need not rehearse the matter; what I have said may suffice.
Behold, the a scriptures are before you; if ye will b wrest them it shall be to your own destruction.
22 Yea, and the voice of the Lord, by the a mouth of angels, doth declare it unto all nations; yea, doth declare it, that they may have glad tidings of great joy; yea, and he doth sound these glad tidings among all his people, yea, even to them that are scattered abroad upon the face of the earth; wherefore they have come unto us.
23 And they are made known unto us in a plain terms, that we may understand, that we cannot err; and this because of our being b wanderers in a strange land; therefore, we are thus highly favored, for we have these glad tidings declared unto us in all parts of our vineyard.
24 For behold, a angels are declaring it unto many at this time in our land; and this is for the purpose of preparing the hearts of the children of men to receive his word at the time of his coming in his glory.
25 And now we only wait to hear the joyful news declared unto us by the mouth of angels, of his coming; for the time cometh, we a know not how soon.
Would to God that it might be in my day; but let it be sooner or later, in it I will rejoice.
26 And it shall be made known unto a just and holy men, by the mouth of angels, at the time of his coming, that the words of our fathers may be fulfilled, according to that which they have spoken concerning him, which was according to the spirit of prophecy which was in them.
29 a Having faith on the Lord; having a hope that ye shall receive eternal life; having the b love of God always in your hearts, that ye may be lifted up at the last day and enter into his c rest .
30 And may the Lord grant unto you repentance, that ye may not bring down his wrath upon you, that ye may not be a bound down by the chains of b hell , that ye may not suffer the second c death .
31 And Alma spake many more words unto the people, which are not written in a this book.
Revelation given through Joseph Smith, at Manchester, New York, March 1830. HC 1: 72–74.
1–3 , Christ has all power; 4–5 , All men must repent or suffer; 6–12 , Eternal punishment is God’s punishment; 13–20 , Christ suffered for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent; 21–28 , Preach the gospel of repentance; 29–41 , Declare glad tidings.
1 I am a Alpha and Omega, b Christ the Lord; yea, even I am he, the beginning and the end, the Redeemer of the c world .
3 Retaining all a power , even to the b destroying of Satan and his works at the c end of the world, and the last great day of judgment, which I shall pass upon the inhabitants thereof, d judging every man according to his e works and the deeds which he hath done.
4 And surely every man must a repent or b suffer , for I, God, am c endless .
5 Wherefore, I a revoke not the judgments which I shall pass, but woes shall go forth, weeping, b wailing and gnashing of teeth, yea, to those who are found on my c left hand.
6 Nevertheless, it is a not written that there shall be no end to this torment, but it is written b endless c torment .
7 Again, it is written a eternal damnation; wherefore it is more express than other scriptures, that it might work upon the hearts of the children of men, altogether for my name’s glory.
8 Wherefore, I will explain unto you this a mystery , for it is meet unto you to know even as mine apostles.
9 I speak unto you that are chosen in this thing, even as one, that you may enter into my a rest .
10 For, behold, the a mystery of godliness, how great is it!
For, behold, I am b endless , and the punishment which is given from my hand is endless c punishment , for d Endless is my name.
11 a Eternal punishment is God’s punishment.
15 Therefore I command you to repent—repent, lest I a smite you by the rod of my mouth, and by my wrath, and by my anger, and your b sufferings be sore—how sore you know not, how exquisite you know not, yea, how hard to bear you know not.
19 Nevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and a finished my preparations unto the children of men.
20 Wherefore, I command you again to repent, lest I a humble you with my almighty power; and that you b confess your sins, lest you suffer these c punishments of which I have spoken, of which in the smallest, yea, even in the least degree you have d tasted at the time I withdrew my Spirit.
21 And I command you that you a preach naught but repentance, and show b not these things unto the world until it is wisdom in me.
22 For they cannot a bear meat now, but b milk they must receive; wherefore, they must not know these things, lest they perish.
23 a Learn of me, and listen to my words; b walk in the c meekness of my Spirit, and you shall have d peace in me.
24 I am Jesus Christ; I a came by the b will of the Father, and I do his will.
25 And again, I command thee that thou shalt not a covet thy b neighbor ’s c wife ; nor seek thy neighbor’s life.
27 Which is my word to the a Gentile , that soon it may go to the b Jew , of whom the Lamanites are a c remnant , that they may believe the gospel, and look not for a d Messiah to come who has already come.
28 And again, I command thee that thou shalt a pray b vocally as well as in thy heart; yea, before the world as well as in secret, in public as well as in private.
29 And thou shalt a declare glad tidings, yea, b publish it upon the mountains, and upon every high place, and among every people that thou shalt be permitted to see.
30 And thou shalt do it with all humility, a trusting in me, b reviling not against revilers.
31 And of a tenets thou shalt not talk, but thou shalt declare repentance and b faith on the Savior, and c remission of sins by d baptism , and by e fire , yea, even the f Holy Ghost.
32 Behold, this is a great and the last a commandment which I shall give unto you concerning this matter; for this shall suffice for thy daily walk, even unto the end of thy life.
33 And misery thou shalt receive if thou wilt slight these a counsels , yea, even the destruction of thyself and property.
34 a Impart a portion of thy property, yea, even part of thy lands, and all save the support of thy b family .
35 Pay the a debt thou hast b contracted with the printer.
Release thyself from c bondage .
37 And a speak freely to all; yea, preach, exhort, declare the b truth , even with a loud voice, with a sound of rejoicing, crying—Hosanna, hosanna, blessed be the name of the Lord God!
38 a Pray always, and I will b pour out my Spirit upon you, and great shall be your blessing—yea, even more than if you should obtain c treasures of earth and corruptibleness to the extent thereof.
39 Behold, canst thou read this without a rejoicing and lifting up thy heart for b gladness ?
40 Or canst thou run about longer as a a blind guide?
41 Or canst thou be a humble and meek, and conduct thyself wisely before me?
Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet and Sidney Rigdon, at or near Fayette, New York, December 1830. HC 1: 128–131.
At this time the Prophet was engaged almost daily in making a translation of the Bible.
The translation was begun as early as June 1830, and both Oliver Cowdery and John Whitmer had served as scribes.
Since they had now been called to other duties, Sidney Rigdon was called by divine appointment to serve as the Prophet’s scribe in this work ( verse 20 ).
As a preface to his record of this revelation the Prophet wrote: “In December Sidney Rigdon came [from Ohio] to inquire of the Lord, and with him came Edward Partridge. .
1–2 , How men may become the sons of God; 3–7 , Sidney Rigdon is called to baptize and confer the Holy Ghost; 8–12 , Signs and miracles are wrought by faith; 13–16 , The Lord’s servants shall thrash the nations by the power of the Spirit; 17–19 , Joseph Smith holds the keys of the mysteries; 20–21 , The elect shall abide the day of the Lord’s coming; 22–27 , Israel shall be saved.
1 Listen to the voice of the a Lord your God, even b Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, whose c course is one d eternal round, the e same today as yesterday, and forever.
2 I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who was a crucified for the sins of the world, even as many as will b believe on my name, that they may become the c sons of God, even d one in e me as I am f one in the Father, as the Father is one in me, that we may be one.
3 Behold, verily, verily, I say unto my servant Sidney, I have looked upon thee and thy works.
I have a heard thy prayers, and prepared thee for a greater work.
4 Thou art blessed, for thou shalt do great things.
Behold thou wast sent forth, even as a John , to prepare the way before me, and before b Elijah which should come, and thou knewest it not.
6 But now I give unto thee a commandment, that thou shalt a baptize by water, and they shall receive the b Holy Ghost by the laying on of the c hands , even as the apostles of old.
7 And it shall come to pass that there shall be a great work in the land, even among the a Gentiles , for their b folly and their abominations shall be made manifest in the eyes of all people.
8 For I am God, and mine arm is not a shortened ; and I will show b miracles , c signs , and wonders, unto all those who d believe on my name.
9 And whoso shall ask it in my name in a faith , they shall b cast out c devils ; they shall heal the d sick ; they shall cause the blind to receive their e sight , and the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak, and the lame to walk.
11 But a without faith shall not anything be shown forth except b desolations upon c Babylon , the same which has made d all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her e fornication .
12 And there are a none that doeth good except those who are ready to b receive the fulness of my gospel, which I have sent forth unto this generation.
14 And their arm shall be my arm, and I will be their a shield and their buckler; and I will gird up their loins, and they shall fight manfully for me; and their b enemies shall be under their feet; and I will let c fall the d sword in their behalf, and by the e fire of mine indignation will I preserve them.
16 And they shall learn the parable of the a fig -tree, for even now already summer is nigh.
18 And I have given unto him the a keys of the mystery of those things which have been b sealed , even things which were from the c foundation of the world, and the things which shall come from this time until the time of my coming, if he d abide in me, and if not, e another will I plant in his stead.
19 Wherefore, watch over him that his faith fail not, and it shall be given by the a Comforter , the b Holy Ghost, that knoweth all things.
21 For they will hear my a voice , and shall b see me, and shall not be c asleep , and shall d abide the day of my e coming ; for they shall be f purified , even as I am pure.
22 And now I say unto you, a tarry with him, and he shall journey with you; forsake him not, and surely these things shall be fulfilled.
23 And a inasmuch as ye do not write, behold, it shall be b given unto him to prophesy; and thou shalt preach my gospel and call on c the holy prophets to prove his words, as they shall be given him.
25 And a Israel shall be b saved in mine own due time; and by the c keys which I have given shall they be led, and no more be confounded at all.
26 a Lift up your hearts and be glad, your b redemption draweth nigh.
27 Fear not, little a flock , the b kingdom is yours until I come.
Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, on the bank of the Missouri River, McIlwaine’s Bend, August 12, 1831. HC 1: 202–205.
On their return trip to Kirtland the Prophet and ten elders had traveled down the Missouri River in canoes.
On the third day of the journey many dangers were experienced.
Elder William W. Phelps, in daylight vision, saw the destroyer riding in power upon the face of the waters.
1–12 , The Lord has decreed many destructions upon the waters; 13–22 , The waters were cursed by John, and the destroyer rideth upon their face; 23–29 , Some have power to command the waters; 30–35 , Elders are to journey two by two and preach the gospel; 36–39 , They are to prepare for the coming of the Son of Man.
1 Behold, and hearken unto the voice of him who has all a power , who is from everlasting to everlasting, even b Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end.
3 But verily I say unto you, that it is not needful for this whole company of mine elders to be moving swiftly upon the waters, whilst the inhabitants on either side are perishing in unbelief.
5 For I, the Lord, have decreed in mine anger many destructions upon the waters; yea, and especially upon these waters.
6 Nevertheless, all flesh is in mine hand, and he that is faithful among you shall not a perish by the waters.
7 Wherefore, it is expedient that my servant Sidney Gilbert and my servant a William W. Phelps be in haste upon their errand and mission.
9 But now, verily I say, it behooveth me that ye should part.
10 And inasmuch as they are a faithful they shall be preserved, and I, the Lord, will be b with them.
11 And let the residue take that which is needful for clothing.
12 Let my servant Sidney Gilbert take that which is not needful with him, as you shall agree.
13 And now, behold, for your a good I gave unto you a b commandment concerning these things; and I, the Lord, will reason with you as with men in days of old.
14 Behold, I, the Lord, in the beginning blessed the a waters ; but in the last days, by the mouth of my servant John, I b cursed the waters.
15 Wherefore, the days will come that no flesh shall be safe upon the waters.
16 And it shall be said in days to come that none is able to go up to the land of Zion upon the waters, but he that is upright in heart.
17 And, as I, the Lord, in the beginning a cursed the land, even so in the last days have I b blessed it, in its time, for the use of my saints, that they may partake the fatness thereof.
19 I, the Lord, have decreed, and the destroyer rideth upon the face thereof, and I revoke not the decree.
20 I, the Lord, was a angry with you yesterday, but today mine anger is turned away.
21 Wherefore, let those concerning whom I have spoken, that should take their journey in haste—again I say unto you, let them take their journey in haste.
22 And it mattereth not unto me, after a little, if it so be that they fill their mission, whether they go by water or by land; let this be as it is made known unto them a according to their judgments hereafter.
23 And now, concerning my servants, Sidney Rigdon, Joseph Smith, Jun., and Oliver Cowdery, let them come not again upon the waters, save it be upon the canal, while journeying unto their homes; or in other words they shall not come upon the waters to journey, save upon the canal.
25 And they shall do a like unto the children of Israel, b pitching their tents by the way.
26 And, behold, this commandment you shall give unto all your brethren.
28 Wherefore, let him do as the Spirit of the living God commandeth him, whether upon the land or upon the waters, as it remaineth with me to do hereafter.
29 And unto you is given the course for the saints, or the way for the saints of the camp of the Lord, to journey.
31 And in that place they shall lift up their voices unto God against that people, yea, unto him whose anger is a kindled against their wickedness, a people who are well-nigh b ripened for destruction.
32 And from thence let them journey for the congregations of their brethren, for their labors even now are wanted more abundantly among them than among the congregations of the wicked.
34 And inasmuch as they do this they shall a rid their garments, and they shall be spotless before me.
35 And let them journey together, or a two by two, as seemeth them good, only let my servant Reynolds Cahoon, and my servant Samuel H. Smith, with whom I am well pleased, be not separated until they return to their homes, and this for a wise purpose in me.
37 And inasmuch as you have humbled yourselves before me, the blessings of the a kingdom are yours.
38 Gird up your loins and be a watchful and be sober, looking forth for the coming of the Son of Man, for he cometh in an hour you think not.
39 Pray always that you enter not into a temptation , that you may abide the day of his coming, whether in life or in death.
Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Hiram, Ohio, November 1831, at the request of Orson Hyde, Luke S. Johnson, Lyman E. Johnson, and William E. McLellin. HC 1: 227–229.
Although this revelation was given in response to supplication that the mind of the Lord be made known concerning the elders named, much of the content pertains to the whole Church.
1–5 , Words of elders when moved upon by the Holy Ghost are scripture; 6–12 , Elders are to preach and baptize, and signs shall follow true believers; 13–24 , Firstborn among the sons of Aaron may serve as the Presiding Bishop (that is, hold the keys of presidency as a bishop) under the direction of the First Presidency; 25–28 , Parents are commanded to teach the gospel to their children; 29–35 , The saints are to observe the Sabbath, labor diligently, and pray.
1 My servant, Orson Hyde, was called by his ordination to proclaim the a everlasting gospel, by the b Spirit of the living God, from people to people, and from land to land, in the c congregations of the wicked, in their d synagogues , reasoning with and e expounding all scriptures unto them.
3 And this is the a ensample unto them, that they shall b speak as they are moved upon by the Holy Ghost.
4 And whatsoever they shall speak when moved upon by the a Holy Ghost shall be scripture, shall be the will of the Lord, shall be the mind of the Lord, shall be the word of the Lord, shall be the voice of the Lord, and the b power of God unto salvation.
5 Behold, this is the promise of the Lord unto you, O ye my servants.
6 Wherefore, be of good a cheer , and do not b fear , for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you; and ye shall bear record of me, even Jesus Christ, that I am the Son of the living God, that I c was , that I am, and that I am to come.
8 a Go ye into all the world, b preach the gospel to every c creature , acting in the d authority which I have given you, e baptizing in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.
9 And a he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be b damned .
10 And he that believeth shall be blest with a signs following, even as it is written.
12 And of as many as the Father shall bear record, to you shall be given power to a seal them up unto eternal life.
15 Wherefore they shall be a high priests who are worthy, and they shall be appointed by the b First Presidency of the Melchizedek Priesthood, except they be literal descendants of c Aaron .
17 For the firstborn holds the right of the presidency over this priesthood, and the a keys or authority of the same.
18 No man has a legal right to this office, to hold the keys of this priesthood, except he be a a literal descendant and the firstborn of Aaron.
19 But, as a a high priest of the Melchizedek Priesthood has authority to officiate in all the lesser offices he may officiate in the office of b bishop when no literal descendant of Aaron can be found, provided he is called and set apart and ordained unto this power, under the hands of the First Presidency of the Melchizedek Priesthood.
20 And a literal descendant of Aaron, also, must be designated by this Presidency, and found worthy, and a anointed , and ordained under the hands of this Presidency, otherwise they are not legally authorized to officiate in their priesthood.
21 But, by virtue of the decree concerning their right of the priesthood descending from father to son, they may claim their a anointing if at any time they can prove their lineage, or do ascertain it by revelation from the Lord under the b hands of the above named Presidency.
24 And if he repent he shall be a forgiven , according to the covenants and b commandments of the church.
25 And again, inasmuch as a parents have children in Zion, or in any of her b stakes which are organized, that c teach them not to understand the d doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, when e eight years old, the f sin be upon the heads of the parents.
26 For this shall be a law unto the a inhabitants of Zion, or in any of her stakes which are organized.
27 And their children shall be a baptized for the b remission of their sins when c eight years old, and receive the laying on of the hands.
28 And they shall also a teach their children to pray, and to walk uprightly before the Lord.
29 And the inhabitants of Zion shall also observe the a Sabbath day to keep it holy.
30 And the inhabitants of Zion also shall remember their a labors , inasmuch as they are appointed to labor, in all faithfulness; for the b idler shall be had in remembrance before the Lord.
31 Now, I, the Lord, am not well a pleased with the inhabitants of Zion, for there are b idlers among them; and their c children are also growing up in d wickedness ; they also e seek not earnestly the riches of eternity, but their eyes are full of f greediness .
32 These things ought not to be, and must be done away from among them; wherefore, let my servant Oliver Cowdery a carry these sayings unto the land of Zion.
33 And a commandment I give unto them—that he that observeth not his a prayers before the Lord in the season thereof, let him be had in b remembrance before the judge of my people.
34 These sayings are a true and faithful; wherefore, transgress them not, neither b take therefrom.
35 Behold, I am a Alpha and Omega, and I b come quickly.

Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet to Oliver Cowdery, at Harmony, Pennsylvania, April 1829.
HC 1: 37–38. Oliver is admonished to be patient, and is urged to be content to write, for the time being, at the dictation of the translator, rather than to attempt to translate.
1–6 , Other ancient records are yet to be translated; 7–14 , The Book of Mormon is translated by study and by spiritual confirmation.
1 Behold, I say unto you, my son, that because you did not a translate according to that which you desired of me, and did commence again to b write for my servant, Joseph Smith, Jun., even so I would that ye should continue until you have finished this record, which I have entrusted unto him.
2 And then, behold, a other b records have I, that I will give unto you power that you may assist to c translate .
3 Be patient, my son, for it is a wisdom in me, and it is not expedient that you should translate at this present time.
4 Behold, the work which you are called to do is to a write for my servant Joseph.
5 And, behold, it is because that you did not continue as you commenced, when you began to translate, that I have taken away this privilege from you.
6 Do not a murmur , my son, for it is wisdom in me that I have dealt with you after this manner.
7 Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me.
8 But, behold, I say unto you, that you must a study it out in your b mind ; then you must c ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your d bosom shall e burn within you; therefore, you shall f feel that it is right.
9 But if it be not right you shall have no such feelings, but you shall have a a stupor of thought that shall cause you to forget the thing which is wrong; therefore, you cannot write that which is b sacred save it be given you from me.
10 Now, if you had known this you could have a translated ; nevertheless, it is not expedient that you should translate now.
12 For, do you not behold that I have a given unto my servant b Joseph sufficient strength, whereby it is made up?
And neither of you have I condemned.
13 Do this thing which I have commanded you, and you shall a prosper .
Be faithful, and yield to no b temptation .
14 Stand fast in the a work wherewith I have b called you, and a hair of your head shall not be lost, and you shall be c lifted up at the last day.
The words of his preaching unto his brethren.
He confoundeth a man who seeketh to overthrow the doctrine of Christ.
A few words concerning the history of the people of Nephi.
Jacob and Joseph seek to persuade men to believe in Christ and keep his commandments—Nephi dies—Wickedness prevails among the Nephites.
1 For behold, it came to pass that *fifty and five years had passed away from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem; wherefore, Nephi gave me, Jacob, a a commandment concerning the b small plates, upon which these things are engraven.
2 And he gave me, Jacob, a commandment that I should a write upon b these plates a few of the things which I considered to be most precious; that I should not touch, save it were lightly, concerning the history of this people which are called the people of Nephi.
3 For he said that the history of his people should be engraven upon his a other plates, and that I should b preserve these plates and hand them down unto my seed, from generation to generation.
4 And if there were preaching which was a sacred , or revelation which was great, or prophesying, that I should engraven the b heads of them upon these plates, and touch upon them as much as it were possible, for Christ’s sake, and for the sake of our people.
5 For because of faith and great anxiety, it truly had been made manifest unto us concerning our people, what things should a happen unto them.
6 And we also had many revelations, and the spirit of much prophecy; wherefore, we knew of a Christ and his kingdom, which should come.
7 Wherefore we labored diligently among our people, that we might persuade them to a come unto Christ, and partake of the goodness of God, that they might enter into his b rest , lest by any means he should swear in his wrath they should not c enter in, as in the d provocation in the days of temptation while the children of Israel were in the e wilderness .
8 Wherefore, we would to God that we could persuade all men a not to rebel against God, to b provoke him to anger, but that all men would believe in Christ, and view his death, and suffer his c cross and bear the shame of the world; wherefore, I, Jacob, take it upon me to fulfil the commandment of my brother Nephi.
9 Now Nephi began to be old, and he saw that he must soon a die ; wherefore, he b anointed a man to be a king and a ruler over his people now, according to the reigns of the c kings .
11 Wherefore, the people were desirous to retain in remembrance his name.
And whoso should reign in his stead were called by the people, second Nephi, third Nephi, and so forth, according to the reigns of the kings; and thus they were called by the people, let them be of whatever name they would.
12 And it came to pass that Nephi died.
13 Now the people which were not a Lamanites were Nephites; nevertheless, they were called Nephites, Jacobites, Josephites, b Zoramites , Lamanites, Lemuelites, and Ishmaelites.
14 But I, Jacob, shall not hereafter distinguish a them by these names, but I shall b call them Lamanites that seek to destroy the people of Nephi, and those who are friendly to Nephi I shall call c Nephites , or the d people of Nephi, according to the reigns of the kings.
15 And now it came to pass that the people of Nephi, under the reign of the second king, began to grow hard in their hearts, and indulge themselves somewhat in wicked practices, such as like unto David of old desiring many a wives and b concubines , and also Solomon, his son.
16 Yea, and they also began to search much a gold and silver, and began to be lifted up somewhat in pride.
17 Wherefore I, Jacob, gave unto them these words as I taught them in the a temple , having first obtained mine b errand from the Lord.
18 For I, Jacob, and my brother Joseph had been a consecrated priests and b teachers of this people, by the hand of Nephi.
19 And we did a magnify our office unto the Lord, taking upon us the b responsibility , answering the sins of the people upon our own heads if we did not c teach them the word of God with all diligence; wherefore, by laboring with our might their d blood might not come upon our garments; otherwise their blood would come upon our garments, and we would not be found spotless at the last day.

Chessboxers go through alternating four-minute long rounds of chess and three-minute boxing rounds with a one-minute break in between.
A maximum total of 11 rounds are fought out—six rounds of chess and five rounds of boxing. The fight begins with a round of chess.
Each player has a respite of 12 minutes during the game of chess, which means the maximum duration of the whole chess game is 24 minutes.
A K.O. or checkmate can lead to an early win, and the fight can also be cut short if a player exceeds the chess time limit or the referee decides the fight has to be aborted.
If the game of chess ends with a tie, it is settled with the points earned in the boxing rounds.
If the boxing fight ends with a tie, the player who had black on the chessboard wins.
- Chess and boxing… how does that go together?
Chessboxing is the ultimate challenge for both the body and the mind.
More and more contemporary athletic disciplines are characterised by multifaceted challenges.
It’s comparable to a biathlon, as one example.
Extreme physical stress is combined with a huge mental challenge.
Chessboxing is a bit more radical than a biathlon, but through targeted training, the body can be prepared for matches just as well as it can for a biathlon.
The alteration between boxing and playing chess represents the biggest challenge.
- When was the first-ever chessboxing fight and when was the WCBO founded?
The first official chessboxing fight ever to be held was the Middleweight World Championship between Iepe the Joker and Luis the Lawyer on the 14th of November 2003 at the Paradiso in Amsterdam.
Iepe the Joker won the match after a dramatic fight in the 11th and last round when Luis the Lawyer exceeded his time limit in chess.
Shortly before this championship, the WCBO was founded.
- What is the goal of the WCBO?
Our primary objective is the official dissemination of chessboxing as a self-contained, internationally recognised athletic discipline.
The cornerstone for out goal has been laid with the founding of the first Chess Boxing Club of Berlin. In addition, we also support initiatives for starting chessboxing clubs nationwide and abroad.
- What does the WCBO’s slogan mean—“Fighting is done in the ring and wars are waged on the board”?
With this slogan, we’re trying to promote aggression management.
Fighting is simply done in the ring where certain fairness rules apply and where there’s a referee.
Wars should be waged on the board, not in reality.
- How did the idea of chessboxing come about?
The idea originates from the comic Le froid eqateur (literally ‘cold equator’) by Enki Bilal.
Chessboxing was initially conceived by the Dutch artist IEPE as an artistic performance in which the themes of a healthy spirit in a healthy body and aggression management played a role.
After just a short period of time, an opportunity arose to further develop the chessboxing concept into a serious sport in collaboration with experts from Berlin and the Dutch chess and boxing federation.
- What would the ultimate chessboxing fight be like?
In an ESPN interview, Lennox Lewis already expressed some interest and prior to the legendary Heavyweight World Championship in Los Angeles in 2005, Vitali Klitschko offered to play a game of chess with Lennox Lewis before they entered the ring.
- How many fights does the WCBO hold each year?
The WCBO aims at holding three to four championship fights each year.

If you were told that en is a Spanish preposition and were asked what it means, you most likely would guess "in" or "on.
" And you'd be right — in both cases. But en can also be translated as "at," "about," "by," "on top of," "upon," "inside of" and other ways, so its use isn't as straightforward as it may appear.
Fortunately, when en doesn't mean "on" or "in," you can usually tell by the context what is meant.
Like some other prepositions, en can seem quite versatile to the foreigner.
Indicating location and meaning "in": El dinero está en la caja. The money is in the box.
I live in Spain. (Note: "In" meaning "inside of" also can be expressed by dentro de.
Indicating location and meaning "on": El dinero está en la mesa. The money is on the table.
He put the posters on the wall. (Note: The preposition a alternatively could have been used in the second sentence.
To express a value: Vendió el carro en $2.000. He sold the car for $2,000.
(Note: The preposition por alternatively could have been used in the previous sentence. Vendió el carro por $2.000.
In numerous expressions, with various meanings: En broma, as a joke; en busca de, in search of; en cambio, on the other hand; en casa, at home; en español, in Spanish; en honor de, in honor of; en la actualidad, presently; en la radio, on radio; en la televisión (TV), on television (TV); en lugar de, instead of; en secreto, in secret; en seguida, immediately; en serio, seriously; en todas partes, everywhere; en vez de, instead of; en vista de, in view of; en vivo, live (as in live TV); en voz alta, in a loud voice; en voz baja, in a soft voice.

As a beginner, you don't need to memorize all the phrases and verbs that use en; of the verb phrases, pensar en (to think about) is the most common one that causes beginners difficulty.
But you should be aware of those uses, so you know that en might not mean "in" or "on.

This article describes Update Rollup 1 for Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 (SP4).
Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 was originally released on June 28, 2005 and updated on September 13, 2005 to a v2 release.
This update rollup contains security-related updates that were produced for Windows 2000 between the release of Windows 2000 SP4 and April 30, 2005.
On April 30, 2005, the contents of Update Rollup 1 were locked for final testing by Microsoft and customer beta testing.
This update rollup also contains several important non-security updates.
This article contains detailed information about this update rollup, answers frequently asked questions, and lists the updates that are included in this update rollup.
Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 makes it easier for customers to enhance and maintain the security and stability of their Windows 2000-based computers.
After the initial release of Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4, Microsoft identified several issues that may occur when you install this update rollup.
These issues are isolated and affect few customers.
These issues are described in this section.
This section also explains how to resolve these issues.
If you are affected by any one of the following issues, we suggest that you install Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 – v2 or apply the individual hotfixes.
Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 – v2 was released on September 13, 2005.
These errors might occur if you performed an express install of Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 before July 18, 2005 and the updated version of the Msxml3.dll file was already installed.
An express install was only available if you manually converted to the Microsoft Update service that was released in June, manually updated to the "v6" Windows Update service, or used the WSUS service that was released in June, 2005.
This issue was remedied on July 18 before the automatic conversion of all customers to Windows Update v6.
The issue does not affect any installations from the Windows Update v4 site or any installations that occurred after July 18.
Under these circumstances, the Msxml3.dll file might have been reduced to a size of 0 bytes.
If you receive one of these error messages after you install Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4, you may be experiencing this problem.
Download and install security update 824151.
Start the recovery console from any Microsoft Windows setup CD.
Then, copy the Msxml3.dll file from the $NtUpdateRollupPackUninstall$ Update Rollup backup folder to the %systemroot%\System32 folder.
Reinstall Update Rollup 1 for Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 (SP4).
You can either reinstall the original version or the v2 version.
Note You could only perform an express install of Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 before July 18 if you manually installed the new Microsoft Update Web service or if you used Windows Server Update Services (WSUS).
This problem does not occur unless you manually upgrade to Microsoft Update from Windows Update version 4 or use Software Update Services (SUS) 1.0.
This issue was addressed by making a minor change to the way that this update rollup was published on Windows Update.
No files were changed to fix this problem.
This issue is fixed in Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 – v2.
This problem may occur if you use a computer that has an older non-Plug-and-Play ISA, EISA, or Micro Channel Architecture (MCA) SCSI controller.
If you have already installed the original version of Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 and have restarted the computer successfully, you do not have this problem.
If you received this error message, start the recovery console from any Windows setup CD.
Then, copy the Scsiport.sys file from the $NtUpdateRollupPackUninstall$ Update Rollup backup folder to the %systemroot%\System32\Drivers folder.
Restart the computer after you copy the file.
Install Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 – v2.
If you restored the older version of the Scsiport.sys file, you should apply this hotfix or the update rollup.
Important This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly.
Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully.
For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs.
On a computer that uses dynamic disks, two system drives may appear after you install Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4.
This problem occurs in the Mountmgr.sys file.
This problem only affects computers that use the dynamic disks feature.
This problem does not appear to affect functionality.
If you experience this problem, the system alternates between the original system drive and the new virtual system drive letter every time that you restart.
You should restart the system if it is not running on the correct system drive letter.
Make sure the system is using the correct system drive letter (the original system drive) at all times until you apply a resolution to this problem.
This guarantees that any software that is installed recognizes the correct system drive.
If you experience this problem, you can install Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 Sp4 – v2.
The hotfix and Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 – v2 are only installed if the system is restarted to the correct system drive before installation.
If the system drive is a non-system drive (a virtual drive), you may be prompted to restart the system before you install the hotfix or the v2 release.
Microsoft has identified a problem in the Fastfat.sys file.
This problem does not affect all systems.
On systems that are affected, you cannot save files from Microsoft Office programs directly to a floppy disk.
(Microsoft Office programs include programs such as Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel.
) Microsoft plans to provide an update to fix this problem on the Microsoft.com/downloads Web site.
The Windows Graphical Identification and Authentication (GINA) logon user interface does not appear.

This value is required by the CoreGuard filter driver that loads when the computer is restarted.
Vormetric CoreGuard is a database encryption product.
If the filter driver is not functioning correctly, unencrypted data may be entered into the SQL database.
Therefore, the database may become corrupted and the data may be unrecoverable.
To resolve this problem, download the VmSP4RegFix.exe tool from Vormetric and run this tool immediately after you install Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 but before you restart the computer.
The information and the solution in this document represents the current view of Microsoft Corporation on these issues as of the date of publication.
This solution is available through Microsoft or through a third-party provider.
Microsoft does not specifically recommend any third-party provider or third-party solution that this article might describe.

The previous issues have been fully addressed in Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 – v2.
These issues will be resolved by individual hotfixes.
These issues affect very few customers and may have third-party solutions.
Where it is possible, an individual hotfix is available from Microsoft Product Support.
These individual hotfixes were not included in Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 – v2 to minimize the exposure to most customers who are not otherwise affected by these issues.
This section describes other known issues. These issues will be resolved by individual hotfixes.
These issues are identified as code issues.
Customers with server clusters who do not have the required security privileges assigned to the domain user account that is used by the Cluster service, will see the cluster service fail to start with a new event message in the system event log explaining the reason and the recommended next step to recover after applying Update Rollup Package 1.
To keep your Server Cluster from experiencing this issue, you must validate that you have the necessary security privilege settings before applying URP1.
Customers with server clusters who have their operating system volume formatted Fat32, will see the Server Cluster service fail to start after applying URP1.
To resolve this issue either before or after application of URP1, use convert.exe to convert your OS partition from Fat32 to NTFS.
To resolve this issue, obtain and install hotfix 904712.
Customers who experience this problem will be able to install the hotfix before or after they install the Update Rollup to resolve this problem.
This hotfix is not included in the Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 – v2 package because of the limited number of customers affected.
After customers install Microsoft Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4, customers who use Sophos Anti-Virus for Windows version 5 may experience a delay when they log on to their networks.
Sophos provides details about how to resolve this problem to Sophos customers.
This problem occurs because you have obsolete signature files and an obsolete Blackdrv.sys file.
To resolve this problem, update to the current signature file.

By including the most important updates for Windows 2000, Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 may help customers make Windows 2000-based computers more secure.
Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 also makes it easier for customers to build new deployment images.
This update rollup requires less predeployment testing, because the number of updates that are included in this update rollup is smaller than the number of updates that are typically included in a service pack.
Most customers installed current versions of many of the files when older updates were installed.
Additionally, Microsoft has already released most of the contents of this update rollup as individual updates and hotfixes.
Individual hotfixes that are not included in this update rollup will be available as individual downloads.
Because Microsoft believes that Update Rollup 1 for Windows SP4 meets the needs of customers better than a new service pack for Windows 2000, Microsoft will not release another service pack for Windows 2000.
Therefore, Windows 2000 SP4 is the final service pack for Windows 2000.
Customers who have not yet installed Windows 2000 SP4 should consider installing Windows 2000 SP4 as soon as possible.
Windows 2000 with SP4 is a prerequisite for Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4.
Q1: Why does Microsoft believe that Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 meets the needs of customers better than a new service pack for Windows 2000?
A1: Microsoft talked to many customers about their plans for maintaining their Windows 2000 deployments.
The most frequent requests were for Microsoft to make keeping Windows 2000-based computers up to date as easy as possible, and for Microsoft to reduce the predeployment testing that customers have to perform.
Update rollups may help customers make their computers more secure.
Update rollups also help customers build new system images without applying and tracking individual hotfixes.
Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 requires less predeployment testing because the number of updates that are included in the update rollup is smaller than the number of updates that are typically included in a service pack.
Because Windows 2000 is a mature product, many of the Windows 2000 hotfixes that were released after the release of Windows 2000 SP4 address relatively obscure problems.
These problems affect a small number of customers.
At this point, an update rollup provides the most usefulness at the least risk of instability.
Q2: How will Microsoft list Update Rollup 1 for Windows SP4 on the Windows Update Web site?
A2: Update Rollup 1 for Windows SP4 is listed as a high-priority update in the "Critical and Service Packs" category on the Windows Update Web site.
During the next few months, Windows Update will transition Windows 2000 customers to a new version of Windows Update.
After this transition, Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 will be listed in the "High Priority Updates" category.
Q3: Should I install Update Rollup 1 for Windows SP4 even if I have kept my Windows 2000 SP4 systems up to date?
Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 contains important fixes that have not previously been part of individual security updates.
Additionally, this update rollup contains enhancements that may help increase system security, increase reliability, reduce support costs, and support the current generation of PC hardware.
To address minor compatibility problems that were introduced by earlier security updates, hotfixes may have updated some files that were installed by the earlier updates.
This update includes the latest versions of these files.
Therefore, even if a system is fully up to date, Windows Update still detects and installs this update rollup.
Customers who use managed security update deployment solutions should decide whether to deploy Update Rollup 1 within their infrastructure.
Q4: Will Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 be distributed over Automatic Updates?
A4: At first, this update rollup will not be distributed over Automatic Updates.
This delay is because of the transition from the Windows Update version 4 infrastructure to the version 6 infrastructure.
This update rollup will be made available as an automatic update in September, 2005.
Q5: Will there be an administrative blocking tool for Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 like there was for Windows XP SP2?
A5: No, Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 is not a service pack.
Therefore, this update rollup does not require the same level of deployment control.
This update rollup is treated like other security or reliability updates.
These updates are typically distributed by Windows Update and by Automatic Updates.
Q6: Do I have to install the individual security bulletin updates before I install Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 on new installations of Windows 2000?
First install Windows 2000 SP4, and then install the update rollup.
After you install the update rollup, run Windows Update to find updates that were released after April 30, 2005, or that were not included in the update rollup.
Q7: Are customers required to install Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4?
A7: Customers are not required to install Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4.
Microsoft designed the update rollup to make it easy to keep Windows 2000-based computers up to date.
Therefore, we strongly recommend that customers install Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 as soon as they can.
Q8: After Update Rollup 1 for Windows SP4 is installed on a computer that is running Windows 2000 SP4, will the service pack level of Windows 2000 change?
The service pack level of the computer remains at Windows 2000 SP4.
After you install Update Rollup 1 for Windows SP4, the computer will be up to date from a life-cycle policy perspective until the end-of-life date for Windows 2000.
The end-of-life date for Windows 2000 will be no sooner than January 1, 2010.
Q9: Is this the first time that Microsoft has produced an update rollup instead of a service pack?
Microsoft has produced update rollups before.
Q10: If Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 offers significant benefits over a new service pack, why does Microsoft not always use update rollups instead of service packs?
A10: Service packs and update rollups play different, yet complimentary roles.
Service packs deliver important updates and new features that customers request before the next release of a major operating system.
Update rollups deliver a group of updates between more major releases.
Microsoft uses update rollups when there is a longer than typical gap between service pack releases.
Later in the life cycle of a product, update rollups make it easier for customers to keep their computers up to date.
When customers install an update rollup, customers do not have to individually install all the updates that are available for a product.
Q11: How does Microsoft decide which hotfixes to include in an update rollup?
A11: Microsoft examines the number of times that customers request and download each hotfix from Microsoft Web sites and from Product Support.
Microsoft also evaluates the potential cost savings for customers.
This evaluation is based on experience in the Windows 2000 data center environment at Microsoft.
Q12: What kinds of updates are included in Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4?
A12: Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 contains all the security updates that were produced for Windows 2000 after the release of SP4 until April 30, 2005.
Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 also contains a small number of important non-security updates.
For example, Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 contains updates to address problems that are time-consuming for support professionals to troubleshoot and fix.
Q13: What specific updates and hotfixes are included in Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4?
A13: The following table lists all the updates and hotfixes that are included in Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4.
Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 changes how telephony server and client computers communicate using the Telephony Application Programming Interface (TAPI).
After you install Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4, a Windows 2000 telephony client accepts only encrypted RPC packets from a telephony server.
The client does not communicate with a telephony server that sends non-encrypted RPC packets.
However, this restriction does not apply to TAPI deployments where the client computers are using mailslot instead of remote procedure call (RPC) for communications with the telephony server.
This restriction also does not apply where the telephony server uses mailslot for communications.
By default, a Windows 2000 client uses mailslot to communicate with the telephony server.
A Windows 2000 client uses RPC only when the client is explicitly configured as connection-oriented.
To configure the client this way, use the tcmsetup command together with the -x switch.
Update Rollup 1 for Windows 2000 SP4 does not contain updates for Windows components that are not included with a clean slipstream install of Windows 2000 SP4.

Information as a concept has a diversity of meanings, from everyday usage to technical settings.
Generally speaking, the concept of information is closely related to notions of constraint , communication , control , data , form , instruction , knowledge , meaning , mental stimulus , pattern , perception , and representation .
According to the Oxford English Dictionary , the first known historical meaning of the word information in English was the act of informing, or giving form or shape to the mind, as in education, instruction, or training. A quote from 1387 English text: "Five books come down from heaven for information of mankind.
a particular instruction. "Melibee had heard the great skills and reasons of Dame Prudence, and her wise information and techniques.
The English word was apparently derived from the Latin accusative form (informationem) of the nominative (informatio): this noun is on its turn derived from the verb "informare" (to inform) in the sense of "to give form to the mind", "to discipline", "instruct", "teach": "Men so wise should go and inform their kings.
" (1330) Inform itself comes (via French) from the Latin verb informare, to give form to, to form an idea of.
Furthermore, Latin itself already even contained the word informatio meaning concept or idea, but the extent to which this may have influenced the development of the word information in English is unclear.
As a final note, the ancient Greek word for form was "μορφή" (morf -> morphe, Morph ) and also είδος eidos (kind, idea, shape, set), the latter word was famously used in a technical philosophical sense by Plato (and later Aristotle ) to denote the ideal identity or essence of something (see Theory of forms ).
"Eidos" can also be associated with thought , proposition or even concept .
Information is a term with many meanings depending on context, but is as a rule closely related to such concepts as meaning, knowledge, instruction, communication, representation, and mental stimulus. Simply stated, information is a message received and understood.
There are many other aspects of information since it is the knowledge acquired through study or experience or instruction. But overall, information is the result of processing, manipulating and organizing data in a way that adds to the knowledge of the person receiving it.
Information is the state of a system of interest. Message is the information materialized.
Information is always about something (size of a parameter, occurrence of an event, value, ethics, etc). Viewed in this manner, information does not have to be accurate; it may be a truth or a lie, or just the sound of a falling tree.
Even a disruptive noise used to inhibit the flow of communication and create misunderstanding would in this view be a form of information. However, generally speaking, if the amount of information in the received message increases, the message is more accurate.
An important variation identifies information as that which would be communicated by a message if it were sent from a sender to a receiver capable of understanding the message. In another variation, it is not required that the sender be capable of understanding the message, or even cognizant that there is a message, making information something that can be extracted from an environment, e.g., through observation , reading or measurement.
Communication theory provides a numerical measure of the uncertainty of an outcome. For example, we can say that "the signal contained thousands of bits of information".
This is used in application of statistics to estimation theory and to science in general. Fisher information is thought of as the amount of information that a message carries about an unobservable parameter.
For example, with a normal likelihood function, the Fisher information is the reciprocal of the variance of the law. In the absence of knowledge of the likelihood law, the Fisher information may be computed from normally distributed score data as the reciprocal of their second moment.
The view of information as a message came into prominence with the publication in 1948 of an influential paper by Claude Shannon, " A Mathematical Theory of Communication .
" This thesis provides the foundations of information theory and endows the word information not only with a technical meaning but also a measure.
If the sending device is equally likely to send any one of a set of N messages, then the preferred measure of "the information produced when one message is chosen from the set" is the base two logarithm of N (This measure is called self-information ).
It is important to recognize the limitations of traditional information theory and algorithmic information theory from the perspective of human meaning.
For example, when referring to the meaning content of a message Shannon noted “Frequently the messages have meaning… these semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem.
The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages” (emphasis in original).
In information theory signals are part of a process, not a substance; they do something, they do not contain any specific meaning. Combining algorithmic information theory and information theory we can conclude that the most random signal contains the most information as it can be interpreted in any way and cannot be compressed.
Michael Reddy noted that "'signals' of the mathematical theory are 'patterns that can be exchanged'.
There is no message contained in the signal, the signals convey the ability to select from a set of possible messages.
" In information theory "the system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design".
Information can be defined as a pattern, a combination of qualities that form a characteristic arrangement. This view assumes neither accuracy nor directly communicating parties, but instead assumes a separation between an object and its representation.
What are commonly referred to as data in computing , statistics , and other fields, are forms of information in this sense. The electro-magnetic patterns in a computer network and connected devices are related to something other than the pattern itself, such as text characters to be displayed and keyboard input.
On the other hand, according to semiotics , data is symbols with certain syntax and information is data with a certain semantic. Painting and drawing contain information to the extent that they represent something such as an assortment of objects on a table, a profile , or a landscape .
But if information can be defined merely as a pattern, does that mean that neither utility nor meaning are necessary components of information?
Arguably a distinction must be made between raw unprocessed data and information which possesses utility, value or some quantum of meaning.
On this view, information may indeed be characterized as a pattern; but this is a necessary condition, not a sufficient one.
When one interprets representation, one can predict a broader pattern from a limited number of observations (inference) or understand the relation between patterns of two different things ( decoding ). One example of the former is to sip a soup to know if it is spoiled; an example of the latter is examining footprints to determine the animal and its condition.
In his book Sensory Ecology, Dusenbery called these causal inputs. Other inputs (information) are important only because they are associated with causal inputs and can be used to predict the occurrence of a causal input at a later time (and perhaps another place).
Some information is important because of association with other information but eventually there must be a connection to a causal input.
In practice, information is usually carried by weak stimuli that must be detected by specialized sensory systems and amplified by energy inputs before they can be functional to the organism or device.
For example, light is often a causal input to plants but provides information to animals. The colored light reflected from a flower is too weak to do much photosynthetic work but the visual system of the bee detects it and the bee's nervous system uses the information to guide the bee to the flower, where the bee often finds nectar or pollen, which are causal inputs, serving a nutritional function.
Information is any type of pattern that influences the formation or transformation of other patterns. In this sense, there is no need for a conscious mind to perceive, much less appreciate, the pattern.
Consider, for example, DNA . The sequence of nucleotides is a pattern that influences the formation and development of an organism without any need for a conscious mind.
Systems theory at times seems to refer to information in this sense, assuming information does not necessarily involve any conscious mind, and patterns circulating (due to feedback ) in the system can be called information.
In other words, it can be said that information in this sense is something potentially perceived as representation, though not created or presented for that purpose.
If, however, the premise of "influence" implies that information has been perceived by a conscious mind and also interpreted by it, the specific context associated with this interpretation may cause the transformation of the information into knowledge .
Stewart (2001) argues that the transformation of information into knowledge is a critical one, lying at the core of value creation and competitive advantage for the modern enterprise.
In 2003 , J. D. Bekenstein claimed there is a growing trend in physics to define the physical world as being made of information itself (and thus information is defined in this way) (see Digital physics ).
Information has a well defined meaning in physics. Examples of this include the phenomenon of quantum entanglement where particles can interact without reference to their separation or the speed of light.
Information itself cannot travel faster than light even if the information is transmitted indirectly. This could lead to the fact that all attempts at physically observing a particle with an "entangled" relationship to another are slowed down, even though the particles are not connected in any other way other than by the information they carry.
Another link is demonstrated by the Maxwell's demon thought experiment.
In this experiment, a direct relationship between information and another physical property, entropy , is demonstrated.
A consequence is that it is impossible to destroy information without increasing the entropy of a system; in practical terms this often means generating heat.
Another, more philosophical, outcome is that information could be thought of as interchangeable with energy .
Thus, in the study of logic gates , the theoretical lower bound of thermal energy released by an AND gate is higher than for the NOT gate (because information is destroyed in an AND gate and simply converted in a NOT gate).
Physical information is of particular importance in the theory of quantum computers .
Records are a specialized form of information.
Essentially, records are information produced consciously or as by-products of business activities or transactions and retained because of their value.
Primarily their value is as evidence of the activities of the organization but they may also be retained for their informational value.
Sound records management ensures that the integrity of records is preserved for as long as they are required.
The international standard on records management, ISO 15489, defines records as "information created, received, and maintained as evidence and information by an organization or person, in pursuance of legal obligations or in the transaction of business". The International Committee on Archives (ICA) Committee on electronic records defined a record as, "a specific piece of recorded information generated, collected or received in the initiation, conduct or completion of an activity and that comprises sufficient content, context and structure to provide proof or evidence of that activity".
Records may be maintained to retain corporate memory of the organization or to meet legal, fiscal or accountability requirements imposed on the organization.
Willis (2005) expressed the view that sound management of business records and information delivered "…six key requirements for good corporate governance …transparency; accountability; due process; compliance; meeting statutory and common law requirements; and security of personal and corporate information.
Beynon-Davies [2] explains the multi-faceted concept of information in terms of that of signs and sign-systems. Signs themselves can be considered in terms of four inter-dependent levels, layers or branches of semiotics : pragmatics, semantics, syntax, and empirics.
Pragmatics is concerned with the purpose of communication. Pragmatics links the issue of signs with that of intention.
The focus of pragmatics is on the intentions of human agents underlying communicative behaviour. In other words, intentions link language to action.

Los Angeles was founded September 4, 1781, by Spanish governor Felipe de Neve as El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Angeles del Río de Porciúncula (The Village of Our Lady, the Queen of the Angels of the river of Porziuncola ).
[5] It became a part of Mexico in 1821, following its independence from Spain. In 1848, at the end of the Mexican-American War , Los Angeles and California were purchased as part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo , thereby becoming part of the United States; Mexico retained the territory of Baja California .
Los Angeles was incorporated as a municipality on April 4, 1850, five months before California achieved statehood .
Los Angeles is one of the world's centers of business , international trade , entertainment , culture , media , fashion , science , technology , and education .
It is home to renowned institutions covering a broad range of professional and cultural fields, and is one of the most substantial economic engines within the United States.
As the home base of Hollywood , it is known as the "Entertainment Capital of the World", leading the world in the creation of motion pictures , television production and recorded music. The importance of the entertainment business to the city has led many celebrities to call Los Angeles and its surrounding suburbs home.
The Los Angeles coastal area was first settled by the Tongva (or Gabrieleños) and Chumash Native American tribes thousands of years ago. The first Europeans arrived in 1542 in an expedition organized by the viceroy of New Spain and commanded by Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo , a Portuguese-born explorer who claimed the area of southern California for the Spanish Empire .
In 1771, Franciscan friar Junípero Serra built the Mission San Gabriel Arcangel near Whittier Narrows , in what is now called San Gabriel Valley . [8] In 1777, the new governor of California, Felipe de Neve , recommended to Antonio María de Bucareli y Ursúa , viceroy of New Spain, that the site noted by Juan Crespí be developed into a pueblo .
Tradition has it that on this day they were escorted by four Spanish colonial soldiers, two priests from the Mission and Governor de Neve. The town was named El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles del Río de Porciúncula (The Town of Our Lady the Queen of the Angels on the Porciúncula River ).
Railroads arrived when the Southern Pacific completed its line to Los Angeles in 1876.
[13] Oil was discovered in 1892, and by 1923 Los Angeles was producing one-quarter of the world's petroleum.
By 1900, the population had grown to more than 102,000 people, [15] putting pressure on the city's water supply.
[16] 1913's completion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct , under the supervision of William Mulholland , assured the continued growth of the city.
In the 1920s, the motion picture and aviation industries flocked to Los Angeles.
In 1932, with population surpassing one million, [17] the city hosted the Summer Olympics .
Also in the 1980s, Los Angeles became the center of the heavy metal music scene, especially glam metal bands. [20] In 1984, the city hosted the Summer Olympic Games for the second time .
Despite being boycotted by 14 Communist countries , the 1984 Olympics became the most financially successful in history, and only the second Olympics to turn a profit – the other being the 1932 Summer Olympics, also held in Los Angeles.
During the remaining decades of the 20th century, the city was plagued by increasing gang warfare, drug trades , and police corruption .
Racial tensions erupted again in 1992 with the Rodney King controversy and the large-scale riots that followed the acquittal of his police attackers.
Voters defeated efforts by the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood to secede from the city in 2002.
Gentrification and urban redevelopment have occurred in many parts of the city, most notably Hollywood , Koreatown , Silver Lake , Echo Park and Downtown .
Los Angeles is irregularly shaped and covers a total area of 498.3 square miles (1,291 km2), comprising 469.1 square miles (1,214.9 km2) of land and 29.2 square miles (75.7 km2) of water.
The city extends for 44 miles (71 km) longitudinally and for 29 miles (47 km) latitudinally. The perimeter of the city is 342 miles (550 km).
The highest point in Los Angeles is Mount Lukens, also called Sister Elsie Peak.
[24] Located at the far reaches of the northeastern San Fernando Valley , it reaches a height of 5,080 ft (1,548 m). The major river is the Los Angeles River , which begins in the Canoga Park district of the city and is largely seasonal.
The period of May through October is warm to hot and dry with average high temperatures of 74 - 84°F (24 - 29°C) and lows of 58 - 66°F (14 - 19°C), however temperatures frequently exceed 90°F (32°C) and occasionally reach 100°F (38°C) in inland areas (away from the moderating effect of the ocean).
The period of November through April is mild and somewhat rainy with average high temperatures of 68 - 73°F (20 - 23°C) and lows of 48 - 53°F (9 - 12°C), but temperatures could occasionally drop to low 40s (~5°C) or be as high as 80°F (26°C) for few days during winter.
The Los Angeles area is also subject to the phenomenon typical of a microclimate .
As such, the temperatures can vary as much as 18°F (10°C) between inland areas and the coast, with a temperature gradient of over one degree per mile (1.6 km) from the coast inland.
California has also a weather phenomenon called " June Gloom or May Grey", which sometimes gives overcast or foggy skies in the morning at the coast, but usually gives sunny skies by noon, during late spring and early summer.
Los Angeles averages 15 inches (385 mm) of precipitation annually, which mainly occurs during the winter and spring (November thru April) with generally light rain showers, but sometimes as heavy rainfall and thunderstorms.
The coast gets slightly less rainfall, while the mountains get slightly more.
Years of average rainfall are rare; the usual pattern is bimodal, with a short string of dry years (perhaps 7-8 inches/175-200 mm) followed by one or two wet years that make up the average.
Snowfall is extremely rare in the city basin, but the mountains within city limits slopes typically receive snowfall every winter.
The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was 2 inches (5 cm) in 1932.
The name given by the Chumash tribe of Native Americans for the area now known as Los Angeles translates to "the valley of smoke". [35] because of the smog from native campfires.
Owing to geography, heavy reliance on automobiles , and the Los Angeles/Long Beach port complex, Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog . The Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley are susceptible to atmospheric inversion , which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles, airplanes, locomotives , shipping , manufacturing, and other sources.
[36] Unlike other large cities that rely on rain to clear smog, Los Angeles gets only 15 inches (381 mm) of rain each year: pollution accumulates over many consecutive days. Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation, including the Clean Air Act .
More recently, the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating low emission vehicles .
As a result, pollution levels have dropped in recent decades. The number of Stage 1 smog alerts has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium.
Despite improvement, the 2006 and 2007 annual reports of the American Lung Association ranked the city as the most polluted in the country with short-term particle pollution and year-round particle pollution.
[38] [39] In 2008, the city was ranked the second most polluted and again had the highest year-round particulate pollution. [40] In addition, the groundwater is increasingly threatened by MTBE from gas stations and perchlorate from rocket fuel .
The city is divided into many neighborhoods, many of which were incorporated places or communities that were annexed by the city. There are also several independent cities around Los Angeles, but they are popularly grouped with the city of Los Angeles, either due to being completely engulfed as enclaves by Los Angeles, or lying within its immediate vicinity.
Generally, the city is divided into the following areas: Downtown Los Angeles , Northeast - including Highland Park and Eagle Rock areas, the Eastside , South Los Angeles (still often colloquially referred to as South Central by locals), the Harbor Area , Hollywood , Wilshire , the Westside and the San Fernando and Crescenta Valleys.
Some well-known communities within Los Angeles include West Adams , Watts , Leimert Park , Baldwin Hills , Venice Beach , the Downtown Financial District , Los Feliz , Silver Lake , Hollywood , Koreatown , Westwood and the more affluent areas of Bel Air , Benedict Canyon , Hollywood Hills , Hancock Park , Pacific Palisades , Century City , and Brentwood .
Important landmarks in Los Angeles include Chinatown , Koreatown , Little Tokyo , Walt Disney Concert Hall , Kodak Theatre , Griffith Observatory , Getty Center , Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum , Los Angeles County Museum of Art , Grauman's Chinese Theatre , Hollywood Sign , Hollywood Boulevard , Capitol Records Tower , Los Angeles City Hall , Hollywood Bowl , Watts Towers , Staples Center , Dodger Stadium and La Placita Olvera / Olvera Street .
According to the census, 33.5% of households had children under 18, 41.9% were married couples , 14.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 37.4% were non-families.
28.5% of households were made up of individuals and 7.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.
The average household size was 2.83 and the average family size 3.56.
The age distribution was: 26.6% under 18, 11.1% from 18 to 24, 34.1% from 25 to 44, 18.6% from 45 to 64, and 9.7% who were 65 or older.
The median age was 32. For every 100 females there were 99.4 males.
The median income for a household was $36,687, and for a family was $39,942. Males had a median income of $31,880, females $30,197.
The per capita income was $20,671. 22.1% of the population and 18.3% of families were below the poverty line .
The economy of Los Angeles is driven by international trade , entertainment ( television , motion pictures , interactive games , recorded music ), aerospace , technology, petroleum, fashion, apparel, and tourism. Los Angeles is also the largest manufacturing center in the western United States.
[51] The contiguous ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach together comprise the fifth busiest port in the world and the most significant port in the Western Hemisphere and is vital to trade within the Pacific Rim . [51] Other significant industries include media production, finance , telecommunications , law , healthcare , and transportation.
Until the mid-1990s, Los Angeles was home to many major financial institutions in the western United States.
Mergers meant reporting to headquarters in other cities.
For instance, First Interstate Bancorp merged with Wells Fargo in 1996, Great Western Bank merged with Washington Mutual in 1998, and Security Pacific Bank merged with Bank of America in 1992.
Los Angeles was also home to the Pacific Exchange , until it closed in 2001.
The city has six major Fortune 500 companies, including aerospace contractor Northrop Grumman , energy company Occidental Petroleum , healthcare provider Health Net , homebuilder KB Home , and real estate group CB Richard Ellis .
Other companies headquartered in Los Angeles include 20th Century Fox , Latham & Watkins , Univision , Metro Interactive, LLC, Premier America , Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher , DeviantArt , [54] Guess?
, O’Melveny & Myers ; Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker , Tokyopop , The Jim Henson Company , Paramount Pictures , Robinsons-May , Sunkist Growers, Incorporated , Fox Sports Net , Capital Group , 21st century Insurance and The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf .
Korean Air 's US passenger and cargo operations headquarters are located in two separate offices in Los Angeles.
The people of Los Angeles are known as Angelenos.
Nighttime hot spots include places such as Downtown Los Angeles, Silver Lake, Hollywood, and West Hollywood , which is the home of the world-famous Sunset Strip .
Because of Los Angeles' large multi-ethnic population, a wide variety of faiths are practiced, including Islam , Buddhism , Hinduism , Zoroastrianism , Sikhism , Bahá'í , various Eastern Orthodox Churches , Sufism and others.
Immigrants from Asia for example, have formed a number of significant Buddhist congregations making the city home to the greatest variety of Buddhists in the world.
In addition to the English- and Spanish-language papers, numerous local periodicals serve immigrant communities in their native languages, including Armenian, Korean, Persian, Russian, Chinese and Japanese. Many cities adjacent to Los Angeles also have their own daily newspapers whose coverage and availability overlaps into certain Los Angeles neighborhoods.
Los Angeles and New York City are the only two media markets to have all seven VHF allocations possible assigned to them.
The city's first television station (and the first in California) was KTLA , which began broadcasting on January 22, 1947. The major network-affiliated television stations in this city are KABC-TV 7 ( ABC ), KCBS 2 ( CBS ), KNBC 4 ( NBC ), KTTV 11 ( FOX ), KTLA 5 ( The CW ), and KCOP-TV 13 ( MyNetworkTV ), and KPXN 30 ( i ).
Several independent television stations also operate in the area, including KCAL-TV 9 (owned by CBS Corporation ), KSCI 18 (focuses primarily on Asian language programming), KWHY-TV 22 (Spanish-language), KNLA-LP 27 (Spanish-language), KSMV-LP 33 (variety)—a low power relay of Ventura-based KJLA 57—KPAL-LP 38, KXLA 44, KDOC-TV 56 (classic programming and local sports), KJLA 57 (variety), and KRCA 62 (Spanish-language).
Los Angeles is the home of the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball , the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League , the Los Angeles Clippers and Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association , the Los Angeles D-Fenders an NBA Development team owned by the Los Angeles Lakers, the Los Angeles Sparks of the WNBA , the Los Angeles Riptide of Major League Lacrosse, and the Los Angeles Avengers of the Arena Football League. Los Angeles is also home to the USC Trojans and the UCLA Bruins in the NCAA, both of which are Division I teams in the Pacific-10 Conference .
Several more teams are in the greater Los Angeles media market : the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim of Major League Baseball and the Anaheim Ducks of the National Hockey League are both based in nearby Anaheim ; and the Los Angeles Galaxy and Club Deportivo Chivas USA of Major League Soccer are both based in neighboring Carson . The city is the largest in the U.S. without an NFL team.
There was a time when Los Angeles boasted two NFL teams, the Rams and the Raiders .
Both left the city in 1995, with the Rams moving to St. Louis and the Raiders heading back to Oakland .
Los Angeles is the second-largest city and television market in the United States , but has no NFL team (see List of television stations in North America by media market ).
Since the franchise's departures the NFL as an organization, and individual NFL owners, have attempted to relocate a team to the city. Immediately following the 1995 NFL season, Seattle Seahawks owner Ken Behring went as far as packing up moving vans to start play in the Rose Bowl under a new team name and logo for the 1996 season.
[69] In 2003, then NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue indicated L.A. would get a new expansion team, a thirty-third franchise, after the choice of Houston over L.A. in the 2002 league expansion round. [70] When the New Orleans Saints were displaced from the Superdome by Hurricane Katrina media outlets reported the NFL was planning to move the team to Los Angeles permanently.
When the tenth Olympic Games were hosted in 1932, the former 10th Street was renamed Olympic Blvd. Super Bowls I and VII were also held in the city as well as soccer's international World Cup in 1994.
Los Angeles also boasts a number of sports venues, including Staples Center , a sports and entertainment complex that also hosts concerts and awards shows such as the Grammys.
Staples Center also serves as the home arena for the Los Angeles Clippers and Los Angeles Lakers of the NBA, the Los Angeles Sparks of the WNBA, the Los Angeles Kings of the NHL and the Avengers of the AFL .
The city is governed by a mayor-council system. The current mayor is Antonio Villaraigosa .
There are 15 city council districts. Other elected city officials include the City Attorney Carmen Trutanich and the City Controller Wendy Greuel .
The city attorney prosecutes misdemeanors within the city limits. The district attorney, elected by county voters, prosecutes misdemeanors in unincorporated areas and in 78 of the 88 cities in the county, as well as felonies throughout the county.
The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) polices the city of Los Angeles, but the city also maintains four specialized police agencies; The Office of Public Safety, within the General Services Department (which is responsible for security and law enforcement services at city facilities, including City Hall, city parks and libraries, the Los Angeles Zoo, and the Convention Center), the Port Police, within the Harbor Department (which is responsible for land, air and sea law enforcement services at the Port of Los Angeles), the Los Angeles City Schools Police department which handles law enforcement for all city schools, and the Airport Police, within the Los Angeles World Airports Department (which is responsible for law enforcement services at all four city-owned airports, including Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), LA/Ontario International Airport (ONT), LA/Palmdale Regional Airport (PMD), and Van Nuys Airport (VNY).
Voters created Neighborhood Councils in the Charter Reform of 1999. First proposed by City Council member Joel Wachs in 1996, they were designed to promote public participation in government and make it more responsive to local needs.
The councils cover districts which are not necessarily identical to the traditional neighborhoods of Los Angeles.
Almost ninety neighborhood councils (NCs) are certified and all " stakeholders " — meaning anyone who lives, works or owns property in a neighborhood — may vote for members of the councils' governing bodies.
Some council bylaws allow other people with a stake in the community to cast ballots as well.
The councils are official government bodies and so their governing bodies and committees must abide by California's Brown Act , which governs the meetings of deliberative assemblies.
The first notable concern of the neighborhood councils collectively was the opposition by some of them in March 2004 to an 18% increase in water rates by the city's Department of Water and Power .
This led the City Council to approve only a limited increase pending independent review.
More recently, some of the councils petitioned the City Council in summer 2006 to allow them to introduce ideas for legislative action, but the City Council put off a decision.
The neighborhood councils have been allocated $50,000 each for administration, outreach and approved neighborhood projects.
In May 2009, the city council floated a measure to reduce the funding of the neighborhood councils to $11,200 each.
Los Angeles has been experiencing significant decline in crime since the mid-1990s, and hit a record low in 2007, with 392 homicides.
According to a May 2001 Drug Threat Assessment by the National Drug Intelligence Center, Los Angeles County is home to 152,000 gang members organized into 1,350 gangs.
[75] Among the most infamous are the Sureños , 18th Street , Mara Salvatrucha , Crips , Bloods street gangs.
The United States Postal Service operates post offices in Los Angeles.
The main Los Angeles Post Office is located at 7001 South Central Avenue.
There are four public universities located within the city limits: California State University, Dominguez Hills (CSUDH), California State University, Los Angeles (CSULA), California State University, Northridge (CSUN) and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).
Private colleges in the city include the American Film Institute Conservatory , Alliant International University , American InterContinental University , American Jewish University , The American Musical and Dramatic Academy - Los Angeles campus , Antioch University 's Los Angeles campus, Art Center College of Design (Art Center), Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science , Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising 's Los Angeles campus (FIDM), Los Angeles Film School , Loyola Marymount University (LMU is also the parent university of Loyola Law School located in Los Angeles), Mount St. Mary's College , National University of California, New York Film Academy in Universal City, CA , Occidental College ("Oxy"), Otis College of Art and Design (Otis), Southern California Institute of Architecture (SCI-Arc), Southwestern Law School , and University of Southern California (USC).
The community college system consists of nine campuses governed by the trustees of the Los Angeles Community College District: East Los Angeles College (ELAC), Los Angeles City College (LACC), Los Angeles Harbor College , Los Angeles Mission College , Los Angeles Pierce College , Los Angeles Valley College (LAVC), Los Angeles Southwest College , Los Angeles Trade-Technical College and West Los Angeles College .
Los Angeles Unified School District serves almost all of the city of Los Angeles, as well as several surrounding communities, with a student population over 800,000. [79] After Proposition 13 was approved in 1978, urban school districts had considerable trouble with funding.
LAUSD has become known for its underfunded, overcrowded and poorly maintained campuses, although its 162 Magnet schools help compete with local private schools.
[80] Several small sections of Los Angeles are in the Las Virgenes Unified School District .
Los Angeles County Office of Education operates the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts . The Los Angeles Public Library system operates 72 public libraries in the city.
The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority and other agencies operate an extensive system of bus lines, as well as subway and light rail lines across Los Angeles County, with a combined daily ridership of 1.7 million. [82] The majority of this (1.4 million) is taken up by the city's bus system, the second busiest in the country.
The subway and light rail combined average the remaining roughly 319,000 boardings per weekday. [83] Altogether, public transit ridership is much lower than many other large cities, with 12% of Los Angeles commuters riding public transportation.
The city's subway system is the ninth busiest in the United States and its light rail system is the country's third busiest .
The rail system includes the Red and Purple subway lines, as well as the Gold , Blue , and Green light rail lines.
The Metro Rapid buses are a bus rapid transit program with stops and frequency similar those of a light rail .
The city is also central to the commuter rail system Metrolink which links Los Angeles to all neighboring counties as well as many suburbs.
The main Los Angeles airport is Los Angeles International Airport ( IATA : LAX, ICAO : KLAX).
The Port of Los Angeles is located in San Pedro Bay in the San Pedro neighborhood, approximately 20 miles (30 km) south of Downtown .
Also called Los Angeles Harbor and WORLDPORT LA, the port complex occupies 7,500 acres (30 km2) of land and water along 43 miles (69 km) of waterfront.
It adjoins the separate Port of Long Beach .
The sea ports of the Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach together make up the Los Angeles – Long Beach Harbor. There are also smaller, non-industrial harbors along L.A.'s coastline.
The port includes four bridges: the Vincent Thomas Bridge , Henry Ford Bridge , Gerald Desmond Bridge , and Commodore Schuyler F. Heim Bridge .
In 2007, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa also recognized a cultural exchange partnership with Tel Aviv , Israel .

It is open; you can go in and out any time you want, right? Right.
Until someone steps in, claims the door as his and tells you you have to pay to get in.
Oh, and he (and everyone else) still considers the door open, because you can see what's on the other side. See, open door, open formats!
Yeah. So, you probably know some open formats already: MP3, OOXML, Xvid, H.264 and the rest of the MPEG-4 mess.
Because their specification is, in fact, open, which means you can implement it anywhere you want... if you pay to cross the door.
Well, I guess you can't implement it afer all.
If freedom is catchy, as some people claim, then free formats would have taken over by now, wouldn't they?
I too wish it was that simple.
Until recently, there wasn't an exact distinction between open and free formats, but such distinction is becoming more and more clear.
It's got to the point where the big corps are attacking free formats to protect their investments in the open ones.
As soon as word got out that Theora would be the baseline video codec of HTML 5, a Nokia representative came out of nowhere and vaguely suggested that a submarine patent may be there somewhere.
Neither he or Nokia have expanded on this, nor will they.
The damage was already done, and Nokia's investments in 3GPP technology were not wasted.
They hadn't paid all that money in licenses, hardware optimizations and research to make MPEG-4 work on cellphones just to let an upstart that everyone else could implement win the race. No way, ese!
And you likely already know about the whole OOXML debacle. How Microsoft got so afraid of OpenDocument (ODF) that they invested millions and millions on a 6000 page pile of — let's face it — crap.
Pure, pointless crap. To beat another office format.
And they bribed every ISO jurisdiction they could.
To beat another office format. Because it would mean everyone would use a single format and make Microsoft's office suite obsolete.
This isn't anymore about closed vs. open formats, and you don't need me to rub it in your face.
It's time to leave those non-free formats behind and look forward for a world of interoperability, a world of doors free to trespass in whatever way you want, and where no one will be able to take that freedom away from anyone else.
tl;dr version: Just because something calls itself an open standard, it doesn't mean it should be trusted.

Spandau is the westernmost district (Bezirk) of the German capital city of Berlin , the town itself situated at the confluence of the Spree and Havel rivers.
Once a town in its own right, Spandau is one of the oldest areas in the Berlin region and still retains much of its own unique character, having been spared the worst of the Allied bombing in the Second World War that so devastated the rest of the city. The center of the town is formed by a dense network of medieval streets and a market square, still retaining a large number of timber-framed buildings.
Maybe the sweetest little bed and breakfast place in Berlin. Outside the center in Spandau, close to lakes and rivers, to the Olympic Stadium and the convention center.

Bornholm [1] is Denmark 's crown jewel. `The Pearl of the Baltic' has sandy beaches on the south of the island which are renowned for their Mediterranean light and feel.
Its forests impart a more rugged feel than found elsewhere in densly-populated Denmark.
Though practically unknown to Americans, this island of light is a favorite vacation spot for Scandinavians, Germans, and Poles. Its position in the middle of the Baltic (it is closer to Sweden, Poland and Germany than to rest of Denmark) gives both a secluded, yet international feel.
As of January 2003 Bornholms five regions assembled into one administrative and political unit called Bornholms Regionskommune. As of January 2007 Bornholm belongs to the Capital Region.
A battle between Denmark and Sweden in 1645 led to Swedish control of the island, but it was brief - they left again the same year. In the Roskildepeace of 1658 Bornholm, Skaane , Halland and Blekinge were given to Sweden.
In 1658 the Swedish commander of Bornholm was killed in Rønne, and the people of Bornholm freed themselves from years of foreign command. Bornholm was given to the Danish king as ‘his island’.
Jens Kofoed, Poul Anker, Peder Olsen and Villum Clausen became champions of liberty. The same four men have, in modern times, given name to the ferries from Bornholmstrafikken.
Bornholm was Danish until World War Two, and then was it taken over by the Germans and later freed by the Russians in 1945; the Russian wouldn’t leave Bornholm because of the progressing cold war and only left after being given some special privileges.
As Bornholm has many tourists each year most people speak either English, German or Swedish, the exception being most of the older population.
Almost all tourist folders are to be found in English, German, Polish and a Scandinavian language.
There is an airport in Rønne and numerous regular flights on a daily basis to Copenhagen are operated by Cimber Air and Danish Air Transport.
Also, Bornholm Airport is an international gateway fulfilling all requirements linked to this fact. Naturally direct booking and luggage check-in to foreign destinations via Copenhagen Airport is available at the ticket office in our air terminal.
You can get to the island by ferry or airplane, but the island also provides excellent opportunities for arriving by private boat.
It’s easy getting around either by car, bus or bicycles.
The charge for a trip from the airport to Rønne is approximately €7, and a trip from Rønne to Nexø(longest distance) is €50.
There are 9 bus lines connecting cities and attractions. Some stops are designed for getting off, walking a scenic route and getting on a bus at the next stop.
The BAT 24 hour ticket at €18 can be a good deal if you travel a few times and do not want to worry about the rates and zones.

Botswana is famous for its wildlife, areas like the Chobe National Park , Moremi National Park in the Okavango Delta and the Central Kalahari Game Reserve have a very high concentration of game. The bulk of the Kalahari desert falls within Botswana's borders and Botswana is home to most of the world's San (bushman) population.
Okavango Delta - A unique geological formation where a delta is formed by a river (the Okavango) flowing into the Kalahari desert instead of the ocean.
There are several entry points by road to Botswana: In the south at Gaborone , providing access from Johannesburg ; in the west providing access from Namibia ; the north providing access from Namibia , Zambia and Zimbabwe ; and at Francistown in the east, providing access from Harare .
All road access is good and the primary roads within Botswana are paved and well maintained.
The roads are paved and well maintained, so travel by car is also not a problem, provided that one keeps a close eye out for the cows, donkeys and goats that spend much time in the middle of the road.
Botswana Railways operates Botwana's railways. The main line goes from Lobatse , near the South African border, via Gaborone to Francistown at the Zimbabwean border.
However, effective April 1, 2009, all passenger services have been withdrawn.
The language of business in Botswana is English and most people speak it, although in the more rural areas many people do not speak English, particularly the older generations.
Botswana's currency is the Pula; 100 Thebe = 1 Pula. In Setswana, pula means "rain" and thebe means "shield.
Nevertheless, crime has been on the rise over the past several years, so always be aware of your surroundings. Basic common sense will keep you safe from the predatory wildlife in rural areas.
Botswana's HIV infection rate, estimated at 24.1% [6] , is the 2ND highest reported in the world. Exercise regular universal precautions when dealing with any bodily fluid and remain aware of this high rate of infection.
Wear rubber gloves when dressing someone else's cut, even if they are a child, and obviously NEVER, EVER HAVE UNPROTECTED SEX. If you form a serious relationship, consider both getting an HIV test before taking things further.

Lao Airlines [8] - Small airline with 4 flights a week to/from Luang Prabang in Laos , also from Vientiane and from Phnom Penh.
Trains to Nanning , China depart from Gia Lam station, about 5 km north of Hanoi station.
All other trains use the main Hanoi train station (Ga Hang Co, 120 Le Duan, tel: 825 3949), for daily services from cities in the south including Hue and Nha Trang .
Tickets for all destinations are sold in the main station, though there are two counter halls, north and south, serving the respective destinations.
Buy your tickets as early as possible, especially since sleeper-tickets can be sold out several days in advance.
If you can't get a ticket anymore, try a travel-agent who still might have stocks. You may also try your luck in the station just before boarding time, agents still holding tickets will be eager to sell as the departure draws near.
Nevertheless, travel agencies in Hanoi are known for their bad business practices.
Some of them will try to overcharge you up to 300%, so it is better go to the train station by yourself and find out about the prices before you agree on any deal.
Most of the "open-tour" bus itineraries either begin or end in Hanoi, with Hue the next (or previous) stop (12-14 hours, US$8-9), and from there to Hoi An , Nha Trang , Dalat , Mui Ne , Ho Chi Minh City , and other cities in Vietnam, depending on the bus company.
Many of the same companies also sell tickets to Vientiane and Savannakhet in Laos (US$16-18), but do some research before you buy a ticket - rattle-trap scam buses abound on this route.
Taxis are the best way to travel long distances, but the cyclos, or pedicabs, are a cheap way to make shorter trips.
Taxi fares are not always consistent, and the rates for each taxi company have not been standardized.
For lone travelers, rides on the back of motorbikes (actually low-powered scooters) are popular too (known as xe om, literally meaning motorbike-hug).
Be very careful with meter taxis in Hanoi.
Some have central locking , and are known to lock passengers in , and demand large amounts of US dollars before letting them go.
The driver may threaten to have you beaten up or arrested should you not give in to his demands , but if you kick up enough of a fuss , they will let you go.
Motorbike drivers can be found on virtually every corner, especially in the Old Quarter. Expect to be offered a ride every half-block (or more).
Negotiate a fare in advance, and again, turn around and walk away if you don't like their offer. There are far more drivers than tourists, and they know it - your fare could be the only one they get all day.
You might want to write down the negotiated fare to avoid confusion. Even if you do speak Vietnamese, a driver might pretend that you said 50,000 dong instead of 15,000!
Many drivers will accept US dollars as well. At the end of a ride , some will offer to hang around to drive you to your next destination - GET A PRICE IN ADVANCE, or you might be surprised when the driver demands several million dong for two 10 minute rides.
Keep your wallet out of arms reach of the drivers when you pay, less honest motorbike drivers are not adverse to grabbing your wallet and helping themselves to any notes they like the look of before jumping on their bike and speeding off.
Negotiate first or avoid using the cyclos services, they demand 200,000VND (US$12) for a short ride of less than 100 metres.
At the end of the journey, a few men will come over to translate, and they will pretend to help and later insist that you pay the demanded amount.
Motorcycles can be rented for around US$5-6 a day, and can be arranged by most hotels. This is good for making lots of trips around the city for individuals or duos, but be careful: Hanoi traffic is very difficult place to sharpen motorbike skills.
Park on the sidewalk with other bikes, and be sure to lock the front wheel. Locals will help arrange the bikes near their stores.
Scam free, cheap but a bit difficult to comprehend at first, the buses in Hanoi are relatively fast and surprisingly comfortable. Pick up a map with printed bus lines at the Trang Tien street (the book street by the Opera house) and spend a few minutes to identify the over 60 bus lines, find your bus stop, wait for the bus, pay 3000 dong and of you go.
Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum (Open mornings only, 8-11AM; closed on afternoons, Mondays, and Fridays. Apparently closed October-December for maintenance of the body.
) The city down south may have his name, but only Hanoi has the man himself, entombed in distinctly Lenin-esque fashion - against his wishes, but that's how it goes. No talking, short pants, or other signs of disrespect allowed while viewing; photos are allowed only from outside, in the grand Ba Dinh Square.
Purses are allowed into the tomb, but expect them to be searched by several bored soldiers along the way. Left luggage is handled in a complicated scheme: there is an office near the street for large bags, with separate windows for Vietnamese and foreigners, and a further office for cameras, which will be transported to a third office right outside the exit of the mausoleum.
Right around the corner, this gleaming white museum and its gloriously ham-handed iconography are the perfect chaser to the solemnity of the mausoleum. The building, completed in 1990, is intended to evoke a white lotus.
One of the more informative museums in Vietnam, and perhaps one of the oddest in the world. Guides are available in English, French, Chinese and Russian, but don't bother; the displays are labeled in English and French, and it's hard to imagine the guides doing much other than belaboring the point.
The exit from the mausoleum takes you right into the grounds of the, uh, vestige, where Ho Chi Minh lived and worked from 1954 until his death in 1969. The nicely landscaped complex includes two of Ho Chi Minh's houses, kept shiny and "as he left them" by the authorities, as well as a garage with two of Ho's cars and a carp-filled pond.
One-Pillar Pagoda&MDASH; Tucked away between the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum and Museum.
Travelers find the One-Pillar Pagoda either charming and lovely or utterly pointless, depending on how many tour groups are crammed into the small grounds at the time of their visit.
Temple of Literature (Văn Miếu) (On Quoc Tu Giam St., south of the Mausoleum.
The Temple of Literature was founded in 1070 and established as the country's first university six years later.
The courtyard features numerous stone tablets, each mounted on the back of a tortoise, with the names of graduates.
National Museum of Vietnamese History (Bảo tàng Lịch sử Việt Nam), No. 1, Trang Tien Street (Admission 15,000 dong/Students 8,000 and under 15 just 2,000.
Hours: 8AM-11:30AM and from 1:30PM-4:30PM. This is a collection from Vietnamese history from about 1000 years back until 1945.
Many antiques and the such. From 1945 onwards, you can go to the Museum of the Vietnamese Revolution located just a five minute walk away.
Museum of the Vietnamese Revolution (Bảo tàng Cách mạng Việt Nam), 25 Tong Dan Street (and 216 Tran Quang Khai Street) Open every day except Monday, from 8AM to 11:45AM and from 1:30PM to 4:15PM Admission 10,000 dong.
This museum gives a very informed and detailed account of the Vietnamese struggle against first the French (starting in 1858 -- on the first floor), then against the Americians (on the ground floor - ending on 30 April 1975).
Hoan Kiem means "returned sword", and the name comes from a legend in which King Le Loi was given a magical sword by the gods, which he used to drive out the invading Chinese. Later, while boating on the lake, he encountered a giant turtle, who grabbed the sword and carried it down to its depths, returning it to the gods from whom it had come.
Hoa Lo Prison ("The Hanoi Hilton"), 1 Hoa Lo, Hoan Kiem, Hanoi.
Open 8:30AM to 11:30AM and 1:30PM to 4:30PM, admission 5,000 dong.
This prison was built by the French at the turn of the 20th century, in classical French prison design.
This is where the French imprisoned and executed many of the Vietnamese freedom fighters. The prison was also used to hold U.S. prisoners of war.
Now a museum (2/3 of the prison was torn down to make way for the Hanoi Towers), the museum exhibits the brutal French colonial regime and the struggle of the Vietnamese people against imperialism in chilling detail.
B-52 Lake - Huu Tiep Lake - Ngoc Ha Precinct, Ba Dinh District— Until December 19, 1972, this was just a small brackish pond just off Hoang Hoa Tam Street, about 1km west of the mausoleum.
On that day, in a twisted retelling of the Hoan Kiem legend (see above), Vietnamese anti-aircraft guns (possibly with the help of flying turtles) retook the enemy's eight-engined, 100-ton sword and sent it too, to the shallow bottom of the lake, where it remains today.
Sit on a plastic chair in front of one of the Bia Hoi (fresh beer) establishments which are invariably situated on the corners of many of Hanoi's 'Old Quarter' streets.
This preservative-free light beer is the perfect drink to sip as you watch the city's frenetic life bustle by.
The beer costs less than twenty cents and gives you an excuse to relax and take photos of the passing local characters. Should not be missed.
Moreover, once you reach the Old Quarter, you will find that almost every corner is filled with stalls selling Pho (Vietnamese noodle) and cafe (the name is not limited only to coffee, but also tea, sweets and grocery items, and yes, even to Pho! ).
Since the mid 90s, Vietnamese cuisine has been catching up again and is now very diverse and most delicious.
Small hotel in the Old Quarter. The rooms have comfortable beds, amazing hot water pressure for showers and good air-con/fan combos.

With a successful steel, finance and high technology industry, a strategic location at the heart of Western Europe, more natural beauty than you might expect given its size, and as one of the top 3 richest countries in the world, Luxembourg enjoys a very high standard of living.
Overrun by Germany in both World Wars, Luxembourg was one of the major battlefields of the Battle of the Bulge in the winter of 1944-1945, a story well documented in the museum at Diekirch . The state ended its neutrality in 1948 when it entered into the Benelux Customs Union and when it joined NATO the following year.
Luxembourg-Findel International Airport ( IATA : LUX) ( ICAO : ELLX) [2] is located 6km outside Luxembourg-City. It is served by Luxair [3] , the national airline, which flies to many EU countries (including Milan and London Gatwick and City) and Dublin , and Air France ( Paris ; actually a Luxair codeshare), KLM ( Amsterdam ), Swiss ( Zurich ), Lufthansa ( Frankfurt ; actually a Luxair codeshare) and British Airways ( London Gatwick).
Alternative airports, especially for low-cast carriers, include Ryanair hub Hahn (aka "Frankfurt-Hahn"), about two hours away by direct Flibco bus [5] , Zweibrücken Airport [6] and Brussels -South Charleroi, served by bus company charleroiexpress.com [7] .
Luxembourg train station can be reached directly from Paris (2 hours), Metz (1 hour), Brussels (3 hours) and Trier (43 min).
Both international and national timetables can be found on the website of the national railways company CFL [8] .
Motorways from Metz (A3), Brussels (A6) and Trier (A1) connect to the ring-road around Luxembourg City, from which most other parts of the country can be reached.
If you want to enjoy a nice view to the city, "Grund" and Kasematten, leave the motorway coming from the East ( Germany ) at exit "Cents". Enter Cents and drive down the hill.
Aside from the airport buses listed above, sometimes there are commuter buses to Trier and Bitburg .
The train is a far preferable option for entering the country from nearby.
Luxembourg being a landlocked country, it's extremely hard to get in by boat.
But if you really want to there are boat links form the German side of the Moselle river to the Luxembourg side, but it is easier walking over the bridges.
Luxembourg is a compact country and it's possible to reach most any place in the country from the capital in under an hour.
The central railway station has a handy Mobiliteit [9] office that will help to plan your trip with bus and train.
The Chemins de Fer Luxembourgeois (CFL) [10] train network is either comprehensive or spartan, depending whether you want to go south or north. While the south is reasonably well covered, the north is limited to one main line (Ligne 10) which runs from Luxembourg City via Mersch, Ettelbrück, Wilwerwiltz, Clervaux and Troisvierges.
To the south you can reach Bettembourg and Esch-sur-Alzette. There is also a line to the east which crosses into Germany over the Moselle River at Wasserbillig.
The same tickets are valid on trains as buses, and the same rates apply: €1.50 for two hours (unlimited transfers) or €4.00 for one day. A €40 month ticket can be purchased at the CFL office under Hamilius, at some newsagencies or at the station.
From an aesthetic view, perhaps the best way to approach Luxembourg City is by train from the north via Ligne 10 as this is a beautifully scenic route past some of the most well-known Luxembourgish sights.
Within the city, the comprehensive bus service is more than adequate for the average tourist.
Buses numbered 1-25 serve the Ville de Luxembourg, with the most useful being the 16 (Town to the Airport via Kirchberg) and the 18 (Town to Kirchberg and Auchan).
Almost all buses include the central bus station Hamilius (centre of town) and the Station (Luxembourg Gare) in their routes at some point.
Any bus pointing stationwards from Hamilius will probably take you there (the 3 being a notable exception).
Bus tickets (which are also valid on trains) are available from the driver. A standard ticket costs €1.50 and will be valid on any bus up to 2 hours after its purchase.
Every village has a convenient bus service which runs at least once every hour.
Buses numbered 100 upwards will take you out of the city.
Useful routes to the north of the country include the 100 (Diekirch via Junglinster, every hour), the 120 (Junglinster, every 30 minutes) and the 290 (Mersch, frequent).
Town buses experienced a reduced service on Saturdays (including those used mainly by shoppers), and many routes are barely existent (if at all) on a Sunday.
This doesn't matter, though, since most shops and attractions are closed on a Sunday.
Almost all national buses run the same on Saturdays (which count as working days in this instance) as during the week, but the Sunday service is usually reduced or non-existent.
Luxembourg's road infrastructure is well-developed if not always very well thought-out.
Anywhere that happens to lie along the major motorways is easily accessible via these (including Grevenmacher in the east, Mamer to the west and Bettembourg to the south).
Esch-Alzette, the country's second city (more like a small town by international standards) has its own motorway link, the A4.
In addition, a new motorway is being built towards the north of the country (Mersch, Ettelbrück), but this won't be completed until 2010 at the earliest.
However, the current North Road provides easy access to these areas for the moment.
Current national speed limits are 50km/h in towns and villages, 90km/h on open country roads (110 in some places on N7 and N11), and 130km/h on the motorway (110 in the rain). 70km/h also exists in some places.
Be aware that if you have a right-hand-drive car then you are very likely to be singled out for a customs check on the way in. Police are also very keen on stopping drivers for having the 'wrong' lights on in town, i.e.
Finding parking in Luxembourg city centre on the weekends is a pain.
Most parking spaces are quickly taken and some parking garages close early.
The best option is to find somewhere near the station and then walk around the city centre. Traffic wardens are also numerous and vigilant.
The streets and landscape in Luxembourg make for good biking territory; highly recommended.
Be wary, though, of small-ish bicycle repair shops in rural corners of the country -- they may quite well charge you quite some money for fixing your bike when they actually break it, more or less subtly.
For bicycle repairs, neighboring Trier (with a considerable University student population) is usually a safer bet.
Hence, again knowing French is your best bet if you want to converse with most people, especially as people working in shops and bars usually come from France or Belgium and don't bother to learn the local native language. English is widely understood by such personnel as bus drivers, but many shop assistants will only respond if addressed in French.
Luxembourg uses the euro, so there is no need to change money if coming in from Belgium, France or Germany.
If you know any coin collectors, take a few local coins as keepsakes, since Luxembourgish coins are among the rarest of the euros — even in Luxembourg, most of your change will be in other countries' coins!
In most restaurants however, the typical local food would be French cuisine coming in bigger portions.
Italian food has been popular since the 1960s.
Home cooking has been very influenced by the recipes of Ketty Thull, apparently the best-selling cooking and baking book in Luxembourg since WW II.
The Luxembourg white wines from the Moselle valley to the east of Luxembourg include Riesling, Pinot Gris, Pinot Blanc, Rivaner and Elbling to name just a few and are good.
Young people tend to drink local or imported beer. Luxembourg has a number of breweries, with Diekirch, from the village of the same name , Bofferding, Battin, and Mousel being the most popular.
Despite the fact that you would be hard pushed to find any of these outside of the country, all are excellent lagers.
Thanks to the heavy banking and EU presence in the city, hotels in central Luxembourg are quite expensive, although there is a good youth hostel (see Luxembourg (city)#Sleep ).
It may be more cost-effective to stay across the border in eg.
Trier and "commute" into Luxembourg, as a day-ticket valid for a return trip and free run of the entire country is only €8.40.
A number of smaller hotels in Luxembourg, mostly in the countryside but including a few in the city, have banded together at hotels.lu [11] .
Many thousands of people commute from neighbouring Belgium, France (Les frontaliers) and Germany on week days, considerably swelling the population of the capital city. The majority work in the numerous financial institutions based in the capital and are drawn across the borders by the excellent salaries on offer.
Luxembourg City has a very international flavour as in addition to les frontaliers, it attracts young professionals from all over the globe.
In this area, business is done predominently in English, French or German and it is necessary to be fluent in one of these as a minimum although many jobs will demand proficiency in at least two.
In many surveys, Luxembourg has been named "safest country in the world".
The food and tap water supply in Luxembourg is perfectly fine and the country's healthcare system is first-class.
The climate is average even though the summers can get hot. However these temperatures only rarely rise much above 30°C.
Try to show respect for the local language and make some effort to say a word or two of it even if it's just the standard greeting "Moien".

Namibia [1] is in Southern Africa , bordering South Africa , Botswana , Angola , Zambia and the Atlantic Ocean. Formerly a colony of Germany , Namibia was administered by South Africa under a League of Nations mandate after WWI, and annexed as a province of South Africa after WWII.
The South-West African People's Organization (SWAPO) launched a guerrilla war for independence in 1966, but did not gain independence until 1990.
Namibia boasts remarkable natural attractions such as the Namib desert, the Fish River Canyon Park , Etosha National Park and the Kalahari desert.
Its people speak nine different languages, including some of the Khoisan languages which include the 'clicks' that present an enigma to most native English-speakers. Namibia produces some of the world's highest quality diamonds.
Swakopmund -- Coastal town, a mecca for Namibians on holiday.
Tsumeb -- Mining town east of Etosha.
Brandberg Mountains -- The highest mountain in Namibia at 2 573 m.
Skeleton Coast -- The northern coastal part of the Namib desert, named for the dozens of ships that were beached in the thick fog that is frequent where the desert meets the Atlantic.
Tourists may enter Namibia for up to 3 months.
Namibia (along with Lesotho , South Africa and Swaziland ) is a member of the Southern African Common Monetary Area and as such the Namibian Dollar (NAD) is pegged 1:1 to the South African Rand (ZAR).
Both the Namibian Dollar and South African Rand is legal tender in Namibia though change will usually be given in Namibian Dollars.
Banks in Namibia will convert Namibian Dollars for South African Rand and vice versa without charge or paperwork.
Since any bank or currency exchange outside Namibia (including other members of the Common Monetary Area) will charge a substantial service fee to change currency, it is advisable to make use of a Namibian Bank before leaving the country.
It is also advisable to carry proof (for example ATM receipts) that money you are taking out of the country is money that you brought into the country in the first place.
Automated teller machines are available in Windhoek , Swakopmund , Luderitz , Tsumeb , and other towns and cities.
It is best to use only teller machines that are inside a mall or other building.
Always be careful to make sure no one is watching you enter your PIN, and be vigilant about typical scams (e.g.
machines that seem to eat your card and won't give it back after you enter the PIN).
Prices in shops are fixed, but prices in open markets or from street vendors are open to barter.
Vegetarians need not apply. Namibians have a very high intake of meat.
It is possible to be a vegetarian in Namibia, however, as there are some Peace Corps workers who live there for two years and remain vegetarian throughout.
you will find local and international cuisine in the many diverse restaurants and cafes.
3 course gourmet dinners on red dune under the stars accompanied with staff entertainment NS 220 pp.
A hotel provides accommodation to the traveling public, has a reception area and offers at least a "breakfast room" or communal eating area.
In general a hotel makes food and beverage services available to a guest, though these may be outsourced or provided by the hotel.
The HIV infection rate in Namibia is about 25%.
Namibia's medical system is modern and capable of attending to whatever needs you may have.
Staff are well trained and so HIV transmission in hospitals is not an issue.
This applies to government and private hospitals alike, though line-ups are often shorter at private hospitals, and there have been cases of incorrect diagnosis in government hospitals.
Namibia's water supply is usually safe to drink, except where labelled otherwise.
Campsites next to rivers often get their water directly from the river, so do not drink it!
Having said all this, make sure you consult a physician specializing in health issues of Southern Africa , as well as things like the Centre for Disease Control [17] web page. Make sure you satisfy yourself of the safety of anything you're getting into.
It is a well developed country (albeit still a developing nation) with all the modern amenities and technologies. Don't show up wearing khaki shorts and a safari hat; people will laugh.
In fact, Namibians refer to this kind of tourist as The Khakis in a derogative manner. And if you ask where the 'real' Africa is (i.e., the Africa of Tarzan), Namibians may very well be offended.
It is customary when greeting someone to ask them how they're doing. It's a simple exchange where each person asks "How are you?
") and responds with a correspondingly short answer, and then proceed with whatever your business is about. It's a good idea to do this at tourist info booths, in markets, when getting into taxis, even in shops in Windhoek (though it's normally not done in some of the bigger stores in the malls).
Each city or region has a two-digit area code. When calling long distance within Namibia, prefix the area code with a '0'.
Mobile phones are very common and run on the GSM network, using the same frequency as Europe and the rest of Africa.
There are Internet cafes in Windhoek, Swakopmund and Opuwo, and hostels often have access as well.
Namibia has two GSM cellular phone operators, MTC [18] and CellOne [19] and both offer prepaid options.
Starter packs and airtime vouchers are readily available at most stores.

Normandy [1] (French: Normandie) is a region of northern France , bordering the English Channel.
Normandy is famed for the D-Day Allied invasion on June 6, 1944.
You can choose to go the whole way if you can walk for a month ! Otherwise select day trips or 2-3 days trips in the most interesting parts: History fans will choose the D-Day beaches , while lovers of spectacular nature (cliffs and coves) will walk around la Cap de la Hague , west of Cherbourg , or choose to walk to Mont Saint Michel .
Weather in Normandy can be unpredictable but is often very nice. One of the best seasons to visit Normandy is September.

Chinatown-North Beach in San Francisco combines two adjoining neighbors, both of whom are among the city's most popular immigrant neighborhoods. Culturally and aesthetically, they could not be more different yet their streets mesh seamlessly together.
This "Little Italy," with its cafes and alfresco dining, has a real European charm and flavor reminiscent of the romance of Europe and Italy. The area runs from roughly Bay Street to the north, Columbus Avenue and Powell Street on the west, San Francisco Bay on the east, and Washington Street on the south with an extension to Sutter Street between Kearny and Powell Streets to encompass the rest of Chinatown.
With pagoda-tiled roofs, Cantonese conversations, busy live-produce markets, mahjong players, and little old Chinese ladies confidently spitting on the pavement — Chinatown [1] is a unique part of San Francisco. Established in 1850, in the area around Portsmouth Plaza, San Francisco's Chinatown is reputed to be the oldest and one of the largest and most famous of all Chinatowns outside of Asia.
Many of the Chinese who settled here were merchants or immigrant workers, working on either the transcontinental railroad or as mine workers during the Gold Rush. Today, it is home for more than 15,000 Chinese and Chinese-Americans, many of whom are low-income, elderly, and foreign born, living in dense tenements.
Chinatown holds a prominent position in the history of Chinese and Chinese-Americans in the United States, from the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 to the present day. The residual "bachelor" society one finds in San Francisco's Chinatown today cannot be understood without some knowledge of these hostile decades.
The Chinatown market area is mainly along Stockton Street, one block above (west of) Grant Avenue, and the east-west streets crossing Stockton. Other San Francisco concentrations of Chinese shops and restaurants are located in the Inner Richmond District , mainly along Clement, and the Outer Sunset District , mainly along Irving.
Forming part of the old Barbary Coast (an extinct neighborhood infamous for its crime, prostitution, and general unruliness), and popular with both locals and tourists alike, North Beach remains one of the most popular and beloved neighborhoods in San Francisco. Nestled between Chinatown to the south and Fisherman's Wharf to the north, North Beach is the Italian part of town and is known by the moniker "Little Italy.
The neighborhood derived its name as the bay shoreline originally reached as far as Taylor and Francisco streets, and the area was indeed a real beach until the city subsequently filled it in. The portion of Grant Avenue that runs straight through North Beach is the oldest street in San Francisco.
North Beach was also the West Coast's capital for the Beatnik movement in the 1950s — you can still see many of the places where Jack Kerouac and the "Dharma Bums" hung out and wrote their dark poetry. Other literati celebrities that hung out there were; Alan Ginsberg, Neal Cassidy (Dean Moriarity in Kerouac's On The Road), and Lawrence Ferlinghetti.
" The area is still full of adult bookstores and strip clubs; despite this, strangely, like everything in San Francisco, it retains a certain charm. Washington Square (another old Beat hangout), in front of the Saints Peter and Paul Church, is a very popular hangout with locals, and a great place to relax.
Driving into the area is not recommended, but if you must, the closest parking garage to Chinatown is underneath Portsmouth Plaza, on Kearny Street (which is a one-way street north) between Clay and Washington.
Other Chinatown garages are the Golden Gateway at 250 Clay Street, North Beach at 755 Vallejo Street, and St. Mary's Square at 433 Kearny Street.
All garages are open 24 hours a day, except for Golden Gateway. There are also a few small parking garages scattered throughout North Beach, including Imperial Parking at 425 Broadway Street.
Driving to the base of Coit Tower is definitely not recommended, as there is a very limited amount of parking at the top of the hill.
Both routes will take you into Chinatown, but the Powell-Mason line is a better bet for getting to North Beach as the Powell-Hyde line turns west at Jackson and proceeds into Russian Hill . To reach Chinatown's famous Grant Avenue via the cable car, exit BART or the MUNI Metro at the Embarcadero Station and catch the California cable car line at California and Market.

Tourist visas are no longer required for citizens of the European Union , United States , Canada , Japan , Switzerland , Liechtenstein , Andorra , Vatican City , Monaco , Iceland , Norway , San Marino , Mongolia , Serbia , Montenegro and the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (except Turkmenistan ).
This applies only for tourist travel lasting less than 90 days.
Customs officials might inquire about the amount being brought into the country. It is prohibited to bring large amounts of Ukrainian currency (hryvnia) in to the country unless it was declared upon leaving Ukraine.
It is advisable to check in advance the customs regulations (e.g.
When entering the country you will be required to complete an immigration form - currently this is a simple white document with two parts that have more or less identical information. Both parts should be completed on arrival: the immigration officer will keep one part and you have to retain the second, which you will need to show to the immigration officer on your departure from the country.
It is not advisable to lose this easily lost scrap of paper, as you'll almost certainly have difficulties on leaving Ukraine (and likely incur a "fine" too). You will need to know where you are going to stay as this is required on the form and the immigration officer will insist that it is filled in.
Special offers on flights come and go, depending on the whim of the carrier. Recently the low-cost airline Wizzair started operations within Ukraine and will start one international route from Kyiv to London Luton airport in December 2008.
There are several airlines which offer direct flights to cities like Dnipropetrovsk (Lufthansa), Donetsk (Lufthansa, Austrian), Odessa (MALEV, LOT, Austrian, CSA Czech Airlines), Kharkiv and Lviv (LOT, Austrian Airlines), but they are more expensive.
Planes used are newer Boeing 737 and 767 aircraft. Ukraine International also recently introduced flights within the country from its hub in Kyiv, mainly flying newer Boeing 737 aircraft.
One can enter Ukraine by train [2] from any land-bordering neighbor.
When coming from Western Europe there will be a wait at the border while the train's bogies are changed in order to adapt to a different rail gauge.
It's generally quicker and cheaper to buy a ticket to the border and then change trains, rather than wait getting through train.
Generally, in Ukraine railway travel is much cheaper than flying, and is comparable (but probably cheaper) to bus or car travel.
It will take at most a whole day to ride across the country, so unless you are in hurry take a train.
It's good practice to take long-distance trains, which are much more comfortable.
Avoid cheap third-class travel if you're cautious of local experiences.
The nearest significant town on the Polish side is Przemyśl , and it's straightford to find by following route # 4 (which passes through Przemyśl), also known as the E40 in European terms.
When you arrive, the road is fairly narrow (no motorway/autobahn this) with a queue of trucks and vans parked to the right of the road; a hard-core parking area with cafe/bar to the left.
Don't stop behind the goods vehicles, slip up the side of them and then feed into the customs area when the guy flags you forward (for courteous Europeans, you're not jumping the queue - commercial traffic goes through a different process).
If you're in an EU registered car then make for the EU-passports, passport control section. Thence to Ukrainian passport control and then Ukrainian customs and then you're through.
It used to be a nightmare, with apocalyptic tales of 5-6+ hours at the border (and as of July 2007, this is still a possibility), but the Ukrainians have made great advances in efficiency and it takes about an hour to make the crossing (September 2005 - still true in Feb 2006).
Don't expect the border police to treat you in a friendly or even respectful manner, in fact, expect anything ranging from neutral to extremely dickish behavior.
Once through, just follow the main road towards Lviv on the E40 - this is the route right across Ukraine to Kyiv (and thence on to the East). Stick to this - the main towns on the way are Lviv, Rivne, Zhytomyr.
You can walk across the 200 meter long bridge from Sighetul Marmatiei, Romania . But once you get to Slatina, Ukraine, it may be difficult to engage onward travel unless you came in a car.
Bicycling is also a possibility in summer.
There are inexpensive direct bus services to Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk from Poland .
There are some ferries from Istanbul , Georgia , Varna (Bulgaria) to Odessa or to Crimea.
The signs are all in Ukrainian (Cyrillic alphabet). Only a few signs (every 200km or so) are written in the Latin alphabet, and indicate main cities.
You are strongly advised to respect the signs, especially speed limits. Be aware that unlike in Western countries, where limits are repeated several times, in Ukraine, an obligation or a prohibition is often indicated on a single sign, which you must not miss.
Speed in cities is limited to 60km/h (40mph).
Speed on highways is limited to 110-120km/h (75mph).
Be aware that corruption is widespread among Ukrainian police, and tourists are an especially profitable target. When you are stopped for speeding or other offenses, officers might aggressively try and extract ridiculous sums of money from you (€100 and up), offering "reductions" if you pay on the spot (the proposed alternative being some unpleasant and more expensive way, all made up).
If you mention that, they'll let you off the hook quicker than you know it. At any rate, write down the officers' badge numbers, rank, plate number of the police car, and notify the nearest embassy/consulate in detail, to help fight these corrupt practices.
Fuel is no longer a problem in Ukraine, especially for those who remember travelling to Ukraine during the early 1990s, when gasoline was considered precious. Today, there are plenty service stations.
There are varying types of fuel, such as diesel, unleaded 95 octane, and (more rarely) unleaded 98 octane; one finds also 80 and 76 octane. Note that if you choose to fill-up in a rural filling station, you will need to pay first, and in cash.
The main roads are okay for all cars, as long as you don't go too fast.
Numerous running repairs have created a patchwork road surface, and it will seriously test your suspension - even on the major dual carriageways.
Secondary roads are passable, but beware: certain zones can be full of potholes and you must treat them with extra care, or avoid them entirely.
Roads between villages are often little more than dirt tracks and not metalled.
Treat as inaccessible unless you're driving a 4x4.
Road works have been ongoing, but the quality of the roads is shy of Western Europe (with the exception of Kyiv )...
Be careful when driving in towns or villages.
Sometimes pets prefer to walk on the road, and they are a hazard for all drivers.
You're likely to see plenty of animals hit by cars, so be prepared...
Also, don't be surprised to see plenty of horse drawn carts - even on the dual carriageways.
There are two major bus companies that run buses from all of the major cities to and from Kyiv, they are Avtolux, and Gunsel.
Prices run about 55-70 Hryvnia (11-13 USD) for service to Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkiv.
The major advantage that the bus service has, is that it leaves from Boryspil and stops in Kyiv, so if your destination is not Kyiv, its easier then taking a bus to the Main Passenger Railway Station in Kyiv.
Aerosvit offers cheap flights and is a time-saving alternative to the slow and inefficient train service.
For example the flight Odesa-Kyiv (One-Way) is ~180 USD (including Tax & all fees) and takes 1.5 hours. However, be sure to book early for the cheapest fares.
The flights can be booked online via www.aerosvit.ua, comfortably in English.
WizzAir, as of early 2009, offers flights between Lviv, Kyiv and Simferopol at competitive prices.
It's possible to go by hitchhiking - usually cargo trucks will take you for free - but it's still worth to try stop personal cars as well.
Good people are everywhere; you may be picked up in a Lada or a Lexus.
If you are outside a big city or in doubt about food, exercise caution and common sense about where you buy food.
Try to buy groceries only in supermarkets or large grocery stores, always check the expiration date, and never buy meat or dairy products on the street (you can buy them on the market, but not near the market).
Hotels might be a traumatic experience for a westerner anywhere outside Kyiv. The cheaper the hotel, the larger the chance of some quite unfortunate surprises, especially for those not familiar with the Soviet-style level of service which still remains in many places.
For instance in IvanoFrankivsk (near the Carpathians), the going rate is approximately 35 euro for a suite (bedroom and sitting room)in Hotel Nadia. Many hotels have the choice between renovated rooms/suites ("western style") and not renovated rooms (easteuropean style).
There are only three 5-star hotels: in Kyiv called the Premier Palace and Opera, and another one in Doneck called Donbass Palace, but they are very expensive.
Two western hotels recently opened, Radisson SAS and Hyatt.
They are not on the cheap side either and are usually full, so make reservations in advance.
Another option is to rent an apartment on the Internet before you leave your country.
There's many to choose from in Kyiv and Odessa. Tip: Read Kyiv in your pocket on Internet!
What many people from ex-soviet countries do is to go to the railway station, where they try to find people who are willing to rent a room.
Prices are usually much cheaper and if there are enough people offering the room you can make great deals (in Yalta people are almost fighting to be able to talk to you).
Opposite, if being arrested by police or other law enforcement - do your best to inform them that you're a foreign visitor. Not many police officials speak foreign languages freely, however many people are eager to assist in translation.
The Euro and US dollar are generally accepted as alternative forms of currency, particularly in tourist areas.
Ukraine has some of the worst statistics for road related deaths and injuries in the world - so act accordingly.
Take care when crossing the roads; walk and drive defensively - be aware that traffic overtakes on both the inside and outside.
Sometimes you even need to take care when using the sidewalks, as in rush-hours the black, slab-sided Audi/BMW/Mercedes sometimes opt to avoid the traffic by using the wide sidewalks; pedestrians or not.
Owners/drivers of expensive cars have been known, at times, to be more careless of the safety of pedestrians. Drivers rarely grant priority to pedestrians crossing a road unless there are pedestrian lights.
Also be warned that pavements suffer in the same way as the roads in terms of collapsing infrastructure. Take care when walking, especially in the dark and away from the downtown areas of the main cities (a torch/flashlight is a useful possession) as the streets are poorly lit, as are most of the entries/stairwells to buildings, and the street and sidewalk surfaces are often dangerously pot-holed.
Ukraine is by no means a conservative country with respect to clothing, behaviour, overcharging you if they can get by with it, getting what you paid for (quality). It is very different from our western perspective in some of these cases.

There’s a lot to do and it’s all as easy as ABCanarias.
‘ Land of a Thousand Volcanoes ’ – this unique island of spent lava fields is recognised as a World Biosphere Reserve.
But amidst this lunar like landscape are fabulous beaches, palm oases, and a cultural history that can be enjoyed throughout the year, thanks to its wonderful climate.
Known as ' the miniature continent ', for the variety of climates and landscapes that can be found on this most developed of the seven Canary Islands.
From the big city bustle of the capital, Las Palmas, to the secluded serenity of its many beaches and lush woodlands, Gran Canarias offers a wide range of sights and activities year round.
Golf courses, yacht marinas, conference centres, theme parks, beaches... Tenerife offers a complete range of leisure activities to satisfy all kinds of tastes.
Under the attentive gaze of El Teide, the highest mountain in Spain, and with the sea as an ever-present backdrop, visitors can experience the rich diversity of its landscape and micro-climates.
The unusual sight of windmills, a reminder of its farming past, can be found throughout the island, which is known as the ‘ granary of the Canary Islands ’.
Despite its desert like landscape it has over one hundred and fifty beaches, the most extensive coastal platform of the archipelago, three thousand hours of sunshine a year and a naturally peaceful environment.
La Palma is called the ' Pretty Isle ' by Canary Islanders for its spectacularly lush vegetation, abundant clear waters and floral wealth which are in sharp contrast to the many volcanic forms that are testimony to the island's origins.
Along with the natural beauty of the island, is a culture rich in traditions, crafts and cuisine that has survived from aboriginal times for everyone to enjoy today.
La Gomera is surprisingly varied and full of contrasts; impressive gorges, grand rock monoliths, marvellous palm groves and the Garajonay National Park, a unique ecological treasure of crystal clear waters and green laurel forests.
The natural wealth of the whole Island is so impressive that it has, in fact, won the highest possible distinction as a protected natural space.
El Hierro is a magic island, and Pozo de la Salud, a prodigious spring with curative properties, adds to the magic, as do the fascinating underwater formations seen just off the rugged coastline.
All this, plus the kind and friendly nature of the people, makes a visit to the smallest of the Canary Islands a charmed experience.

Unless you seriously want to recompile some of the drivers, there is NO reason to download any of the source archives.

An error occurred during the upgrade!
What's the meaning of the messages while starting XAMPP?
Apache doesn't seems to start. What can I do?
What do I do if the error message is "Invalid argument: Could not set permissions on ssl_mutex"?
What do I do if the error message is »Invalid argument: Configuration failed«?
What do I do if the error message is »The configuration file now needs a secret passphrase (blowfish_secret)« shows up?
After I rebooted my Linux box XAMPP stopped running! How can I fix this?
How can I make my XAMPP installation more secure?
How do I backup/restore my XAMPP system?
If you donwloaded a wrong version you will get an error message if you try to upgrade.
By the way: It doesn't matter where in the filesystem you extract the packet. Just make sure it's on the same machine as your XAMPP installation.
After unpacking the archive you can start the upgrade process.
By the way: the upgrade will stop a running XAMPP and will start XAMPP as soon as the upgrade is finished.
XAMPP will be started after an upgrade even if it was not running before.
The upgrade program carefully tried to upgrade one of your configuration files.
In order to upgrade the file, the program had to edit some lines you had already changed.
Seeing as nobody wants to lose valuable configuration information, the upgrade program decided not to change the file but save a copy of the new file in addition to the original one.
The LAMPP startup script did not start XAMPP-Apache because there is an Apache instance already running.
To start XAMPP properly, first you have to stop this daemon.
Mostly due to the same reasons as the above error. The LAMPP startup script found a MySQL daemon already running on your system.
To start LAMPP properly, you have to stop this daemon first.
XAMPP needs a newer Linux distribution that uses the glibc 2.1 version.
Good question :) This error can exist for multiple reasons.
If you now see "Invalid argument: Could not set permissions on ssl_mutex" or "Invalid argument: Unable to create scoreboard" please take a look at answers below. If you see another error message please email it to me.
In this case you have to change the Group directive (about line 318) in /opt/lampp/etc/httpd.conf.
In this case you have to remove the hash (#) in front of the Scoreboard directive (about line 71) in /opt/lampp/etc/httpd.conf.
Now this error message should not bother you anymore.
In this case, Apache is unable to get the IP address for your host name.
It should normally work but sometimes (mostly if you're using DHCP) this situation could happen.
Simply call the following command (Please use copy&paste.
This will fix the configuation error of your system and the »Configuration failed« error should dissapear.
This message may appear since XAMPP for Linux 1.2 was released.
Since version 2.5.2, phpMyAdmin supports the encryption of cookie-saved passwords.
Edit config.inc.php at line 60. You find this file in the phpmyadmin directory of your XAMPP installation.
Since version 4 - I think - SELinux is activated by default and this is preventing the succesful start of XAMPP.
If you know a better solution, please email me. I'm no SELinux expert and the only I know about SELinux is how to disable it.
That's normal Linux behaviour (which applies to any other Unix-like system.
It's the admin's job to make sure a particular application is started at bootup.
You should now see a line containing a number between two colons.
In most cases 3 or 5 (2 if you're using Debian).
Now XAMPP should start and stop automatically if you boot or shutdown your machine.
And than use the runlevel editor (expert mode) from YaST to activate XAMPP for the specific runlevels.
XAMPP: Your XAMPP pages are NOT secured by a password.
XAMPP: MySQL has no root passwort set!!
Remove the semicolon at the beginning of each line and restart XAMPP.
Now the extension should be active.
I have only had a few chances to test this feature, so please report if this worked for you or not: oswald@apachefriends.org.
Warning: The backup and restore functionality is still under development and may not work correctly.
Where secret is your MySQL root password.
The file /opt/lampp/backup/xampp-backup-22-01-04.sh (in the example above) contains your backuped data.
Get this file to a save place.
On the new machine you need the same version of XAMPP as on your original/source machine.
As you can read you may need to restart XAMPP.
It should work perfectly (I tested it many times) but remember it's a beta feature.

The Aro gTér is a stream of Vajrayana Buddhism in which ordination is congruous with romance, marriage, and family life.
It focuses on the teaching and practice of the Inner Tantras from the point of view Dzogchen an essential non-dual teaching.
The Aro gTér tradition is possibly unique in its applicability to Western people.
Due to the predominance of the Dzogchen perspective, the Aro gTér emphasises: assimilation with everyday working life; appreciative sexual equality; the spiritual dimension of romantic relationship; artistic creativity; and the pursuit of life enhancing engagement with the Arts and challenging physical skill – such as equestrianism.
Students practice within the context of their ordinary lives: marrying, raising families, and engaging in the activities of life which are common to the general population.
Practitioners in the Aro tradition reside in Great Britain, North America, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, and Finland.
The Aro gTér is a cycle of teachings revealed by the female visionary, Aro Lingma (1886 – 1923) and is based entirely in the three Inner Tantras of Nyingma Vajrayana.
The Nyingma Tradition traces its origins to the first spread of Buddhism in Tibet, to the time of the Tantric Buddhas: Padmasambhava and Yeshé Tsogyel.
Ngak’chang Rinpoche and Khandro Déchen are the current Lineage Holders of the Aro gTér and teach as a couple.
They make it a priority in their teaching activities to facilitate their students in viewing their relationships and family lives as key spiritual practice.
As representatives of a lineage founded by a woman, they are keen to help women become spiritual practitioners and teachers – and therefore children are always welcome on retreats.
They have encouraged the founding of three other sanghas through their disciples Ngala Rig’dzin Dorje and Tsalgyür Wangmo, Ngala Nor’dzin Pamo and Ngala ’ö-Dzin Tridral, and Ngakma Shardröl Du-nyam Wangmo.
Ngala Rig’dzin Dorje and Tsalgyür Wangmo teach and guide their sangha in Continental Europe and Scandinavia; Ngala Nor’dzin and Ngala ’ö-Dzin teach and guide their sangha in Britain; and Ngakma Shardröl teaches and guides her sangha in the USA.
Ngak’chang Rinpoche and Khandro Déchen’s sangha are found in Britain and the USA.
They teach twice a year in the USA, in New York and California.
The Aro gTér Lineage has been passed down through a line of enlightened women originating with Yeshé Tsogyel and continuing to the great gTértön Khyungchen Aro Lingma (1886 – 1923).
Ngak’chang Rinpoche is the incarnation of Aro Yeshé the son of Khyungchen Aro Lingma.
Aro gTér practice is entirely Inner Tantra – from the perspective of Dzogchen.
This means that yogic song, silent sitting, mantra recitation, and sKu-mNyé (physical yogic exercises) play a central part in practitioners lives.
This is a colourful, energetic lineage where craft, thangka painting, namkha (sky-weaving), cham (Tantric dance), Tantric orchestra, and appreciation of sensory experience are celebrated.
In comparison to other Traditions, the Aro gTér is non-monastic and therefore far less emphasis is placed on practices such as liturgical recitation, sadhana (rituals and detailed visualisation) and cho-pa (ritual offering practices).
Lamas of this tradition teach according to the ethos of Dzogchen both formally and through the simple spontaneity of informal situations.
The Tibetan word Lama means not only the external teacher, but also the internal teacher – which is our beginninglessly enlightened nature.
The rôle of the Lama is to mirror the student.
This mirroring is a means of reflecting the students innate realisation – and his or her own pattern of confusion.
The Lamas therefore encourage apprentices to regard their whole lives as practice – both practically and inspirationally.
The Apprenticeship Programme developed by Ngak’chang Rinpoche and Khandro Déchen is an effective method of working with students who are seriously interested in the practices of the Aro gTér.
Apprentices practise under the direction of their Lamas.
Guidance and transmission are given through: dynamic personal instruction; group question and answer sessions; shared meditation; yogic song; and, by being amongst their apprentices.
Apprentices who have studied and practised with the Aro Lamas for five years have the opportunity to take ngakpa / ngakma or naljorpa / naljorma ordination.
Both ordinations are for those who have realistically come to regard the Lamas as their root teachers (Tsa-wa’i Lamas).
Ordination is for those who regard the tradition, lineage, and practice as the most important part of their lives.
The Aro gTér lineage follows the Vajrayana gö-kar chang-lo style of practice which emphasises transformation.
Its practitioners are known by their white skirts and uncut hair.
The Vajrayana path of transformation is well suited to people who are inspired to practice using their everyday life circumstances as the path to realisation.
At the encouragement of Kyabjé Düdjom Rinpoche, Ngak’chang Rinpoche and Khandro Déchen have established an ordained gö-kar chang-lo sangha in the West.
Sixty students have taken this step (as of 2006), and others are working toward it.
There are now three strong gö-kar chang-lo sanghas in the West and it is established that this lineage of ordination will continue to grow under the guidance of their Lamas.
At the Ordination Retreat in Baarlo, Netherlands in January 2000, sixteen apprentices took ordination into the gö kar chang-lo’i dé. Among them were three apprentices of Ngala Rig’dzin Dorje, who were the first in his sangha to take these vows.
Two large appliqué thangkas were brought from Austria for the event, one of Yeshé Tsogyel and the one seen here of Padmakara in the form of Guru Nang-srid Zilngön. These appliqué thangkas were made by the sangha of Ngala Rig’dzin Dorje on a series of intensive Vajrayana craft retreats, and are a wonderful example of the energy of the Aro gTér tradition in the West.
Gradually over the week of the craft retreat, Ngala Nor’dzin directed the process and order of events.
After the lotus petals, the sun and moon were placed.
Then we worked on the khatvangha, making the skulls, flames and tail separately.
Then we assembled Yeshé Tsogyel’s robes, face and hat.
Lama Nor’dzin was particularly pleased with the attention to detail.
The face of Yeshé Tsogyel had been embroidered in Nepal to Ngak’chang Rinpoche’s specific design.
However we needed to add lengths of hair to the appliqué.
Sang-gyé plaited ribbon hair extensions and included some strands of hair from Ngak’chang Rinpoche and Khandro Déchen, and from Kyabjé Chhi’mèd Rig’dzin Rinpoche in the plaits.
There was one memorable moment, when everyone thought we had really practically finished the appliqué.
Mmmm … I think we might need to double that braid to get the right effect.
This was towards the end of the last day, and some apprentices – being tired – insisted that the single width looked fine.
However, Ngala Nor’dzin was not convinced, and so Naljorma Rin’dzin dashed out to her car and sped down to the haberdashers to buy another length before they closed.
On her return a second row of braid was carefully sewn next to the first on the edges of the shawl.
But no – Ngala Nor’dzin felt that the blue of the central stripe of the shawl was not quite the right blue and we had to embroider over it with a better colour.
Finally all agreed that these extra efforts did made a substantial difference and added to our experience of finishing the appliqué with a real sense of accomplishment.

And they also regard themselves as ambassadors for the entire Alpine region: twelve tremendous, internationally well known and popular places, all with the same good fortune of being located in one of the world's most breathtakingly gorgeous landscapes.
Best of the Alps is the brand name for the great tradition of hospitality offered by Alpine resorts considered pioneers in the fields of skiing and mountaineering holidays.
They all share one unique quality. The uniqueness of the mountains and beauty of the landscapes has been superbly blended into the requirements of modern, activity-based holidaymaking.
But they're also regarded as the Best of the Alps due to their outstanding transport connections, the diversity of the culture waiting to be explored, and not least because of the almost mythical fame of their mountain ranges, such as the Dolomites and Mont Blanc massif, to name but a few.
And, of course, it goes without saying: these holiday resorts offer an enormous range of hotel accommodations from the highest to most modest of categories, as well as a spectrum of culinary delights that ranges from the exquisitely regional to top-class international delights.

Coffee and tea facilities in room would have been good. Food was not great.
Very comfortable hotel extremely convenient for the ski Gondola situated below the hotel. best location in Soldeu.

They could use a no-smoking area in the lobby.
I expected internet access in the room - we had to go to the lobby.
It was expensive, compared to other ski resorts I have visited, and the ski area does not justify the costs.
Position of the hotel, nice warm bedrooms, restaurant & choice of food. Bar & restaurant staff were excellent.
This is an hotel for smoking people(I think like all the hotels in andorra).I'll appreciate a non smoking area the next time.

Rooms are a bit dated, breakfast is poor.
Bathroom was a little tired and the hot water was only just warm making bathing a little unpleasant.

The hotel was clean friendly and close to the airport which was our objective.I would have no hesitation in staying there again.It completely served my purpose.
I found the staff very helpful, with all the facillties available.The location was also excellent, also to the main city centre, it's only a walking distance. And off course the beach.
I am thinking booking in this hotel again the next time I will be in '' Cyprus''.
the service was unfriendly as i have said above; the breakfast dreadful and unappetising.
completely lack lustre. we wont be back.
The Hotel is basic and the staff helpful and all spoke good English.
Useful location, 5 minute walk to the local fish restaurants, and beach. The Hotel has a smallish swimming pool (no complaints) lovely for a quick dip & sun-bathing.
For a short inexpensive stay, I recommend the Cactus, you won't get the frills of a large Hotel, but who cares, when even breakfast was adequate.
Bring your own shampoo and liquid soap, or buy in the local minimarket.
There wasn't a minibar in the room which is a must in all hot locations - I suggest that the Hotel up their price to provide a minibar or at least rent-out minibars to guests that want them.
Staff didnt really care about all the things that were wrong with the room. Generally the hotel is run down and the other ones in the area for the same price looked much nicer.

Faults common to many budget hotels in Germany, like: too big and too soft pillows, curtains not so thick to shade morning light, walls so thin you could hear every worker get up and get ready at 7 a.m. (I think my room was next to somebody's else toilet).
Also: average buffet for those who enjoy continental breakfast, but lousy for latinos like me who just have a croissant or a slice of cake in the morning (not a single one offered! ).
It was very close to messe exchibition , clean and small-frendly.
I was expecting the breakfast to have more choices of sweet staff, or even fresh squeezed juices.

Other than its location which seems more in an industrial park it was a great hotel.
hotel was booked because of shuttle service - time of required service was confirmed at time of booking but upon arrival, this service was not available.
the reason why most people stay at airport hotels is because of flight times are early morning. there is no point offering this service if it is so limited.
I took the room for the proposed shuttle service but this service only goes to the airport or next train station from 8 am to 5 pm which did not suit me.

When booking a twin room I would expect 2 std width single beds, either separate or together.
Blankets on the top of the be were not freshly washed.
The single room was really nice. It was totally new.

Posizione ottima per visitare la città. Due minuti a piedi per arrivare al Trocadero.
Closeness to the Eiffel Tower and thats about all!
The pictures were not what the hotel presented in true life. The stairs were dangerous, as well as the elevator.
I was overall very displeased and felt I over spent for what they had to offer. We were with a few other people who also rented rooms, we had to argue about everything.
They had us booked longer than we planned, which made the billing inaccurate. They had the wrong type of rooms available for us compared to what we reserved and wwhen I asked questions refering to their actual website and what its amenities were they were unsure of it.
The room was nice,clean, little bit small but enough to stay over night.
Close to Eifel Tower and Arc the Triumpf.
10 min to Eiffel tower on foot. Close to almost any of the historical and shopping places.

nothing, i left almost immediately due to the state of the accomodation, even after viewing a second room.
The only unfortunate thing about this hotel was that during the warm, sunny weather that we enjoyed during our time in Cork, the room was a uncomfortably hot to sleep in.

The hotel staff were very helpful.
Breakfast and room very nice and clean.
Little natural light in the room (this may not apply to all rooms), however this didn't bother us too much.
Internet should be available everywhere (guest rooms) and should be free or at least less expensive. In nowdays, Internet is essential in both work and leisure trips, and paying to access the Internet using small paper cards with passwords is a thing of the 20th century, not acceptable in 2009.
Old Florence charm with clean, chic decoration which suited the age and style of the building. We had a room which adjoined to one next door with our sons, but still afforded privacy.
Cereals, fruit, ham, cheese and scrambled eggs. Coffee came pre-made in a flask - not what one expects in a hotel of this calibre.
One thing that always buffles me about europe city trips. There are no tea/coffee making facilities in the room.

Great economy hotel! Wonderful location, safe and very close to Lisbon's attractions; also, many cafes and restaurants nearby, so no need to search for a nice place to eat.
The breakfast was very poor, both regarding quality and quantity.
Location was very close to a lot of things: metro/tram access, restaurants/fast food/pastry shops, shopping areas.
Hotel was clean and lobby was spacious. Breakfast was included and quality of coffee/cocoa/food was good.
Very close to all the sights.
Staff was very helpful when needing information.
Noise coming from halls through the doors.
Breakfast basic (but acceptable given price). Street noise from late night revellers/early deliveries may be an issue for front facing rooms (though not particularly for me).
Overall very convenient and excellent value for money.
The hotel is very well situated, within walking distance of the main attractions, 100 metres from a metro station and near plenty of bars and restaurants. Staff were generally helpful and multilingual.
Breakfast was included, but was so bad that we decided to go somewhere else on the second day. Rooms facing the street can be noisy, and they can feel very small if you are staying more than one or two days...
The breakfast was quite mediocre but to be fair was included in the excellent price of the room.
The location of the hotel is excellent, on a pedestrianised street, where you can walk straight to the city centre.
The hotel is in a great location, the triple room was very good, we got a good breakfast and all for just over €30 each per night!! great value.
We had a large room our friends a smaller one both were good.Continental breakfast was very good.Recommended.

very nice, very friendly very clean, very cheap!!! !
We got to the hotel around 8am after arriving via the Hotel Train from Madrid and were graciously able to check in early since the room was free. It was a life-saver to be able to catch a little more sleep and take a shower.
Not for our use, but I will note the hotel is up a few flight of stairs with no elevator-- fine for us but could be difficult for others.
Hot water did last very long at all - not even 5 minutes.
The staff were very friendly & helpful. It was also located in the heart of the city.
The stuff is actually not very friendly and not professional. We didn't feel welcomed there.
The rooms and bed covers could have been cleaner.
Everything - small rooms, terrible and small beds, poor shared bathroom facilities, and very simple, small things that could be easily fixed but that were missing such as shower heads, faucets, and more.
Location of hotel, it was in city center.
The Hotel is really in the centre of Lisbon and its easy to find and quite nice place to stay there for a few days.
The rooms don't have any heating systems.
Plus our room had a broken window unable to close.
Lack of heating can be a serious problem if not uncomfortable if stayed during the wintertime.
I wouldn't recommend it as there are a number of nice hostels providing same facilities for similar prices...
Very well located. Nice and helpful staff.

The pillows on the bed were, for me, too thick/firm and made sleeping a bit uncomfortable.
Suff is really friendly and helpfull.

The design of the room was very nice, buffet breakfast was good, parking was free and seemed very safe, staff were friendly and helpful.
The maid service was totally unacceptable.
Expendable supplies (shampoo, bathing foam, tissues) were not replaced, pizamas were left unfolded, shirts left for cleaning in the (within the bag supplied from the Hotel and with the appropriate document filled out) were found in the same place (not picked up) in the afternoon.
